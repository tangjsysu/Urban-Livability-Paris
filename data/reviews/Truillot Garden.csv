ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiOEtTZTdRRRAB,"Rather modern garden with trees, it is well laid out and planted with trees with play areas for children. This garden of more than 5,000 m2 is designed as a breath of fresh air in this very dense neighborhood: its central axis creates a shortcut between the promenade on Boulevard Richard-Lenoir and Boulevard Voltaire, and opens up a clear view of the Saint-Ambroise church and his square. On the Richard-Lenoir side, the entrance to the perspective offers an abundant setting around a wetland. Opposite the cr√®che, two play areas are set up around a fun meadow where logs from trees cut down in Paris are reused. The heart of the garden, next to Impasse Truillot, is open to artistic expressions: a square hosts cultural events. at the foot of a frescoed wall. On the plot bordering Boulevard Voltaire, a vast lawn is bordered by flowering fallows, vines and fruit trees.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnZ0xmc3J3RRAB,"Edit 2021: The eastern half of the square was demolished, leveled and rebuilt. It's nice to know that we are rich enough to afford the biennial reconstruction of the squares in Paris. Hopefully the new drainage will work. Still no sports ground for the little ones, I imagine that the collective of neighbors can't stand the noise. Paris is a party... except after 50 years.  ...... 2019: One point because we ended up opening this square, and we needed one. +1 because it is open 24 hours a day - could there be a cultural revolution in the parks and gardens of Paris? On the other hand, in what way is the locked vegetable garden reserved for a privileged few more socially useful than the basketball and football field which, even temporarily, allowed children to play something other than video games?
