ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURibU1yQ2xRRRAB,"Passages created in the 19th century, with the main characteristics of being covered by glass roofs letting in daylight while sheltering traders, customers and suppliers from bad weather; mainly located in the central districts of Paris  Some are absolutely beautiful, with refined interior decoration and a floor covered in mosaics, benefiting from good maintenance; while others, more popular, are less frequented and abandoned. Some seem a little disordered like the Passage des Panoramas, but are full of restaurant terraces with various cuisines: worth trying if only for the cachet of the decor and the cuisine that you don't necessarily find elsewhere ü§©. Others, without being temples of luxury, are rather well maintained and famous for some of their boutiques and their proximity to picturesque places, such as the Jouffroy passage, where the exit to the Gr√©vin museum is located (replicas of celebrities in wax). and toy and souvenir shops (La Bo√Æte √† Joujoux) or old book bookstores. Others house rather luxurious artisanal businesses like the V√©ro Dodat gallery, close to the Ministry of Culture and the Louvre Museum. And also, the gallery having been occupied by the Jou√©Club stores, next to T√™te Dans Les Nuages ‚Äã‚ÄãüéÆ, on the Boulevards des Italians...  Most of these covered passages are passable by wheelchair or with a stroller, but be careful of the crowds, especially where there are restaurant terraces facing each other! And the middle of the Jouffroy passage, with a staircase, to be avoided if you are in the cases mentioned above",5 months ago,2025-01-24 11:37:54.724782,4.0,Golden Flower,"1,623",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103997385110436356996/reviews?hl=en-GB
