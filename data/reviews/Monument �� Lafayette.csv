ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURObWZtdEx3EAE,"Visiting the Monument √† Lafayette was an incredibly moving experience. The statue of Lafayette stands majestically, embodying not just a person but an era filled with revolution and the pursuit of freedom. The surrounding area resonates with a sense of history and the spirit of those who bravely fought for liberty.  What struck me most was the palpable sense of inspiration that this monument evokes. Standing there, I couldn't help but feel deeply moved by the bravery and determination of Lafayette and his compatriots who fought for freedom. It's a place that not only commemorates history but also connects you to the ideals and struggles of the past.  An intriguing fact I discovered through Google research is that this monument is one of the few erected during Lafayette's lifetime. This fact adds a layer of authenticity and significance to the monument, making it even more special. It's not just a tribute; it's a contemporary acknowledgment of Lafayette's impact on history.  The Monument √† Lafayette is a blend of historical significance and aesthetic beauty. It has the remarkable ability to evoke strong emotions and reflection in its visitors. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in revolutionary history or looking to experience a profound connection with the past. This monument is a must-visit for its ability to beautifully capture and convey the essence of a pivotal moment in history.",11 months ago,2024-12-27 21:37:06.794841,5.0,Daniel Neuhaus,178,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106423677302961815900/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDNTlXMmd3RRAB,"The bronze statue sits on a high pedestal. General de La Fayette brandishes a sword vertically in his hand RIGHT.  It is located on the Cours de la Reine between the Grand Palais and the Seine in the 8th arrondissement. from Paris. An American named Robert Thompson, wishing to thank France for the¬†Statue of Liberty¬†offered to the Americans, opened a subscription with American schoolchildren in order to erect a statue to the glory of General La Fayette. France approved the project in 1899, the sculptor chosen was the American Paul Wayland Bartlett (1865-1925). The deadline was given for the Universal Exhibition of 1900. Because the deadline was too short, the sculptor made a plaster model. The inauguration took place on July 4, 1900, the anniversary of American independence. The statue is installed in the Cour Napol√©on of the Louvre. Subsequently, the sculptor must make the statue in bronze, but he is not satisfied with his work. He replaces the Louis XVI costume with a costume from the revolutionary era. He removes the wig and the tricorn making him appear bareheaded. The sword that he held by the sheath is presented drawn with the blade upwards. It was not until 1908 that the bronze statue replaced the plaster project. Due to the work on the development of the Louvre pyramid, the statue was transported to its current location on April 10, 1985. To make fun of himself and his slowness, the sculptor made a small turtle appear under the legs. of the horse on the left side (invisible from the ground, pedestal too high).",4 years ago,2024-12-27 21:37:06.801843,5.0,Jean Marco92,643,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114146936200095763256/reviews?hl=en
