I spent a lot of time searching, asking multiple staff members at the Eiffel Tower for help, and no one knew where the meeting point was. Some even directed me outside the garden, and I was given an outdated address by the information desk.  After all that, the staff blamed me for being late, even though it was their misleading instructions that caused the delay. Their service was not only unprofessional but also rude. They refused to help, gave incorrect information, and didn’t take any responsibility for their mistakes.  If you’re planning a trip to Paris, walk away from this company and book with someone else!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6cnY2SGx3RRAB,"So, it wasn't all good, but City Vision and their staff were excellent. Highly recommend!  First booking; the combination Eiffel Tower summit visit and Seine River cruise. Even for a nasty, windy evening, the crowds were huge. Waiting in long lines, even with the tour bypasses, took over an hour. But the guide Sebastian was excellent,  providing background information and answers to questions. Finally we were at the second level, with access via stairs to the summit.  Windy and cold, and crowded like sardines, but nevertheless spectacular views of Paris lighting up. The cruise we decided to pass on, and the tickets provided are good for a year. Excellent value.  The second booking was for appointment access to the Louvre Museum, Mona Lisa hall, and followed by as much time desired throughout the museum. But there was a surprise ""mini strike"" by museum employees, over what we never found out. But by the time the museum opened, it was afternoon,  and the lines for everyone were huge. We were all given refunds from the nearby office, with apologies for things beyond PCV's control.  An unfortunate waste of time, but well-handled by Paris City Vision.  Highly recommended.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKMXREVmt3RRAB,"Tour from Paris to Mont St. Michel. I will say that we had a great tour guide, I felt she was very knowledgeable and she was very funny. We also thoroughly enjoyed Mont. St. Michel itself, the tour guide lead us in a great direction where it didn’t seem like the stairs were so much, and it seemed we went a secret way, which was very fun and away from the crowds. What I did not enjoy was the bus. The seats are way too close and we were squished in there like sardines and for an 8 hour trip in one day it was just too tight. My daughter is 5’4 and I will show a picture of her when the person in front of her put the seat back and she has to put her leg in the aisle. It was too close for myself also. I could have given a head massage to the person in front of me, and the bus was full so there was no where to move. Also I didn’t feel that we could enjoy a sit down meal at the La Mere Poulard to have the special omelette due to the length of the guided tour, maybe 1/2 hour less would get more appropriate for us to look around. Now there are other items to eat that take much less time, but if you had your hopes on eating at this restaurant, you may not have enough time, so maybe a 1/2 hour less during the tour, or opt out of the guided tour all together and just take the bus which some people did. I would have liked at least another hour to look around, so I would not recommend this tour if you’d like a little more time or prefer more room on the bus.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiNzRLZU93EAE,"First time in Paris and the Louvre was a must see. Glad I did it with a tour instead of on my own because the tour offers a condensed version of the Louvre that highlights all of the big exhibits and you get an overview of all the wings. This tour lasted 2.5 hours, so that was perfect for us because we were on a tight schedule. Our guide Monica was very friendly, knowledgeable,  and passionate about art/history. I like how she had some supplemental displays in her folder that helped elaborate on the history of some pieces. Everyone gets a receiver and new earbuds to hear the tour guide when navigatiging through the Louvre. The audio worked about 97% of the time. The 1 downside was the directions on how to find Paris City Vision tour group. The directions emailed to me were wrong and I heard others complaining about it too. Paris City Vision is on the right side of the Arc with the Pyramid behind you. There is no building or stand. Just some guides standing outside near some benches with a few small red flags that say Meeting Point ( not big red, white, and blue as advertised). I still give the tour 5/5 because the tour itself was great.
