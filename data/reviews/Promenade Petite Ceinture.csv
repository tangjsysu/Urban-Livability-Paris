The Petite Ceinture, a 32 km railway line, was built around Paris during the Second Empire (1852-1869). The section from Place Balard to Rue Olivier de Serres was closed to travelers in 1934, but remained used by freight trains until the 1980s. Vegetation is gradually taking hold on railway structures, creating habitats conducive to flora and fauna.
