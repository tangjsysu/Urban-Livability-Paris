Ticket includes a small glass of wine which on the day of our visit was not particularly good. Overall we expected much more in a country and city with an amazing wine heritage.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1b00zSU1BEAE,"What an amazing experience! Unlike the more touristy wine tasting classes, Emmanuel let us choose the wines we wanted to taste from their extensive wine cellar, and even purchase them. He was so friendly, knowledgeable and patient, and his English was fantastic. Especially when you consider the myriad technical terms and wine making techniques he needed to use to answer our endless questions! Reservations were easy- you just have to email (they don't have it available online). Marie Elise took extra time to helped us package up our wine securely, so it could travel home in our suitcases. She was so kind, and a delight to talk with, and was able to make further wine recommendations based on our tasting. And you get to tour the museum with an audio guide. It was quirky, we learned a lot, and it winds through the ancient wine caves. Thank you so much, we had an amazing experience!",,2024-12-28 16:16:25.590220,,Kathleen Campbell,4,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116365403208894043916/reviews?hl=en-GB

Caves themselves are intriguing visually and the story is fascinating. However, the museum itself was a little boring. It looked like a collection of flea market finds. Also, if they want to attract international visitors, they should have the signage in more than one language. The audio set was helpful though.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMThfeGV3EAE,"If you book a wine tasting course, make sure to send a follow-up email specifying English if you don't speak French. We showed up for our wine tasting course and were told it wouldn't be a problem for the instructor to accommodate our English request as we understood little French. When the course started, it took only moments for us to be excluded. The instructor would speak for 3-5mins in French and then turn to us and ask if we understood, or simply summarize it in 1 sentence and move on. There were many insults made about us (in French to the group), and when the instructor made a racist comment about us, it was time to leave. The instructor made one last jab at us as we left the tasting course.  On our way out, Yoan assisted us, and quickly came up with a solution. He explained that his English wasn't the best, but if we wanted, we could proceed with a private wine tasting with him in English. We agreed, and our experience changed almost instantly. Yoan turned our unpleasant experience into something amazing. His English was not a problem for us. He was knowledgeable, patient, informative, and full of real-world tips about wine.  It was a sensational experience.  If not for Yoan, this would be a 1* review. If we had Yoan from the start, it would be a 5* review.  We would recommend this experience, but ask for Yoan.  **Edited date visited and added proof of purchase for owner.",,2024-12-28 16:16:25.593221,,Evan Overbaugh,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105123312561943147363/reviews?hl=en

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtb3BmZ2lRRRAB,"Hidden gem in the 16th distrikt, where you need to take your time to wonder around slowly reading the many informations and looking at the rich collection of large and many tiny objects. My favorite part was the ticket with the glass of wine and the President of the association who explained and took time to speak to us at the end of the visit. Wondering in the tunnels once quarries along the Seine is like a travel in history, although I would say it is not a very commercial museum, it is small and private and you need to take your time here. You can buy wines from 12 euro to 1900 euro and they also do wine tasting courses we saw going on in one of the vaults. The courtyard outside the museum is so Paris like and just a beauty to the eyes.

I smells vinegar from the wine. Sommelier tolds me that it is for old vintage. It's ridiculous. As I know that wines doesn't have vinegar smell at most 2008 vintage.
