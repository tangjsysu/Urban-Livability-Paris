The atmosphere is filled with a profound sense of peace.  Another special moment is hearing the call to prayer (adhan), a gentle sound that fills the space and captures the heart with a feeling of devotion and unity. Worshippers bow in deep silence, bringing a sense of togetherness and tranquility, despite all the differences and cultures they may carry.
