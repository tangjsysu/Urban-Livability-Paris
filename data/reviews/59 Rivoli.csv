ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIMlpmMG9BRRAB,"We decided to try something different and free while in Paris. My friends found the Artist Studio at 59 Rivoli...so we checked it.  It is close to a Metro stop. And, the guy at reception was nice. I left a few Euros in the ""tip"" basket for a contribution to the artists. We then started walking up the stairs. There were a lot of people because hey, it is free, it is art in Paris and it was cold and rainy outside.  Many of the artist where there. I ended up purchasing some small items. Some of the artists were actually painting/working. Cool to watch and not really sure how they could focus with people talking and walking around them. It was really packed with people so it got hot and walking around was more like shuffling.  It doesn't take much time to see it all. Some stuff was really cool and other stuff not so thrilling.  What I enjoyed most was the building and how it was painted inside. As you can see by my photos. The top floor was cool. We enjoyed the short excursion.  NOTE...

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQZ3ZLQmV3EAE,"A highly unique experience which is sure to fascinate any visual artist. 59 Rivoli is a center solely dedicated to visual arts, that is to say, you won't find any novels or songs here. Additionally, almost all of the showcased works are situated firmly within the ""modern art"" umbrella, which certainly isn't for everybody. The building seems like it is ever-changing, but when I visited, it was divided into 2 sections: One is a small two-floored gallery where finished products seem to be showcased. The artworks vary from paintings, to sculptures, to murals, and more. Almost all of them physically present in the piece, rather than digital pieces. The second part is a six-story building where the artists themselves work. The completely open-to-public nature of these floors allows for anyone to walk among the work-in-progress paintings, and half-built models, and watch the artists live at work. This means that if any artwork or particular style catches your attention, you can chat directly with the artist. This humanizing aspect of 59 Rivoli is definitely what makes in interesting and sets it apart from being just another modern art gallery. I would recommend any artistic soul passing by the area to give this building a visit, no matter how short, no matter how interested you may be in modern art. Simply because it is such a unique experience.",a month ago,2024-12-28 15:23:47.014207,3.0,Can Taşkın,75,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110811695235582874469/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6bFBlTUN3EAE,"59 Rivoli is a winding portal to a world where art knows no boundaries. It’s a living, breathing studio of craftspeople that are creating before your very eyes and exploring their own potential. The artists are professionals, restless seekers who have earned a residency in this amazing space and are driven to collaborate and foster community (apparent by the frequent banter found on each story).  The unassuming building opens to a spiral staircase that leads up, up, up into a bevy of visual wonders - and there isn’t a single corner untouched by something magical. We spent hours canoodling on each floor, which was distinct and projected its own identity.  59 Rivoli isn’t a typical museum, and as such does not require an entrance fee. That said, they do accept donations, which I highly recommend. The first floor (“0” in Paris, n’est pas?) did feature recognized talent from other locales - in our case, we saw an American by way of Barcelona - as well as some live artists producing and selling in the common area.  What an awesome gem to unearth. It’s located in a fantastic neighborhood with a plethora of cafes and boulangeries that are perfect for chatting and discussing the work over a glass of wine and warm baguette. Don’t miss this place.",6 months ago,2024-12-28 15:23:47.015208,5.0,Matthew Garrepy,16,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110024654205361529614/reviews?hl=en

Walking through each floor seeing some art being created in real time and the finished pieces was awesome. I've never been in a place where you can watch artists create like this.
