ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2allPRGhRRRAB,"Very nice exhibition on perfumes at the moment and at the same time the museum is really interesting and complements what we already know. Being interested in social issues, I was able to learn new things and I also liked the connection with the admirable Familistère de Guise which I also visited. We were well received, the museum is pleasant to visit, especially since we were alone for the visit and we were able to take our time and see everything peacefully.",2 months ago,2025-03-15 22:53:03.858525,5.0,Karine Broyart,676,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113303468019814178995/reviews?hl=en-US
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5cU0yWnZ3RRAB,"Small museum presenting on the ground floor the local history from viticulture to industry, the first floor is more devoted to town planning and to Henri Sellier who was mayor of the city between 1919 and 1941 and minister of public health in the government on the popular front, he was one of the promoters of garden cities. The exhibitions are generally related to town planning and quite informative. The museum is located in the old Suresnes Longchamp station and the T2 tram stops at upstairs level but you still have to go down a flight of stairs. The reception also serves as a shop and an elevator connects the ground floor and the 1st floor. Temporary exhibitions regularly. The museum is free on the first Sunday of the month.",3 months ago,2025-03-15 22:53:03.858525,4.0,Thierry Girard,989,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100981567033985110977/reviews?hl=en-US
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqMzVXS0VREAE,If you love the garden city then the permanent collection is a real treat. We see the city being built little by little. The postcards showing the different streets take us back in time. Lots of short films that bear witness to the past of schools and systems for children. Temporary exhibitions are also available.,10 months ago,2025-03-15 22:53:03.859609,4.0,Fatih Mah,68,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109197819710438063352/reviews?hl=en-US

Friendly staff, the children really liked it and got into the game... Target object: a chair or rather a “seat”. Friendly approach, the children participated..

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKcFpTSGdBRRAB,"We were sitting on the terrace of the café opposite the museum with a friend, an employee was waiting near the museum when her superior arrived and verbally attacked her by telling her ""why did you come early"" in an aggressive tone of voice ""I won't pay you for overtime, there's no point in you asking me for it"" this short, stocky woman with bobbed hair should be ashamed of publicly humiliating her employee. This type of behavior is to be prohibited and has been denounced.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlNjVPMEJREAE,"I was lucky enough to have an outstanding guide to visit this museum. I appreciated his passion and the way he conveyed it. There is a way to better understand the city and the ""drawers"" under certain pieces of furniture give access to really interesting elements (which could not have been exposed without this tip of installing them in the drawers). It's a small museum on a human scale and a great invitation to learn in an interactive way.",2 years ago,2025-03-15 22:53:03.862613,5.0,Valerie Bruneau Roucoules,137,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102131193169192301578/reviews?hl=en
