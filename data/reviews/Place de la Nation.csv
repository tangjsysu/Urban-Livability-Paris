ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNFNXJ1MUVnEAE,"This historical square was originally known as the Place du Trone as it had a throne in it, then a guillotine during the French Revolution, and lastly an impressive statue you can still admire today. When you look back at the history of the Place de la Nation, the square was originally named the Place du Trone, which generally translates to Place of the Throne in English, and this was due to the fact that a throne was actually put in place in 1660.  And this was erected in the square in the July of that year ready for the arrival of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa of Spain after their marriage. At the time, this square in Paris was actually located in countryside outside of the city limits, yet in the 1780s the very unpopular Wall of the Farmers General, or Mur des Germiers Generaux in French, was being constructed from the designs of the architect in charge, Claude Nicolas Ledoux.  Now this wall was designed to have gates in order to obtain taxes on goods entering the city, and the one located here was called the throne gate with its impressive columns, or Colonnes de la Barriere du Trone, as they are called.  And these can still be seen today close to the Place de la Nation along with the two pavilions that were erected called the Barrier du Trone or Pavillons du Trone.",5 years ago,2025-01-24 14:09:42.675460,5.0,nima farhadi,134,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117372309136404045915/reviews?hl=en-GB
