ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURRX3JhaUl3EAE,"My favorite place in Paris. The museum traces, in an accurate and touching way, the history of Montmartre, bringing the visitor into contact with the artistic, revolutionary and avant-garde spirit of the neighborhood. The construction of the basilique du Sacr√©-C≈ìur, the cabarets, the Commune and the artistic community of Montmartre are just some of the themes retraced by the museum, accompanied by a rich apparatus of finds, such as photographs of the time, posters, flyers, newspapers and paintings of the artists who lived and worked in the neighborhood. The wonderful garden is an integral part of the visit and manages to convey great peace and inspiration. The visit also includes the atelier of Suzanne Valadon, whose life is told in a beautiful video at the beginning of the visit. The staff is attentive, friendly and very helpful: one gentleman even went out of his way to tell me and explain unusual anecdotes and details related to the world of cabaret. I appreciated it very much. Furthermore, at the time of the visit the caf√© was closed and the garden partially unusable, so to apologize for the inconvenience the staff gave each visitor old exhibition catalogues and even notebooks as a gift!",4 days ago,2025-03-15 23:13:53.563780,5.0,Elena Innocenti,8,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106254033321650364805/reviews?hl=en-US

It is about painters in Montmarte. I was floored to see the historical photos of Montmarte in the 18th century‚Ä¶. It looks like a plain farmland!
