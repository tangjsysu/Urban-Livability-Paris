DURING THE LITURGY, SOMETHING IS UNDERSTOOD ONLY IN THE FACE. OTHERWISE, people talk, it's a constant bustle, they stay in one place for 5 minutes, then come back, if the children don't take me for a walk to calm down, etc. In conclusion, from the middle of the church in the back you can't understand anything and you can't concentrate on the service. It's an atmosphere like at the MARKET. PEOPLE WHO DRESS UP and stand around, especially during the sermon. THE PRIEST IS SPEAKING, THE PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING. If you want to find peace of mind, this is not the right place. Church staff should discipline their parishioners. And to educate them why they come to church and how people should behave.
