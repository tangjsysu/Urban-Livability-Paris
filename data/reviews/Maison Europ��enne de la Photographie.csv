We were confronted with the work of Zanele Muholi on two floors, one floor with her personal work revolting against her 40 years she spent as a maid of a white family and the 2nd floor as a gay person and the suffering of the community as a whole and she herself. It feels like the MEP is run by women and imposes the visitors to share their vision or at least win them over to like it. The small ground floor was also a female photographer who offered no relief in great photos. Personally I have seen much more interesting work from gay photographers at Breda Photo which touched the same subject but the organization left room for those who are beyond the gay problem photography. There are so many other subjects to take photos of that are equally important than the female gay problem. Let's talk about autism in France and how families with autistic children are treated by the government.
