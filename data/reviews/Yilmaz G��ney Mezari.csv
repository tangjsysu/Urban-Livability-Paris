ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYcThuUEdBEAE,"As I stand in front of the grave of Yılmaz Güney in the Cimetière du Père-Lachaise in Paris, the importance and tragedy of this place immediately become clear to me. The grave is simple but dignified, surrounded by fresh flowers and small mementos left by his followers and admirers. The gravestone bears his name and the years of his life (1937–1984), which represent a remarkable life, but also one marked by struggles and resistance.  Yılmaz Güney was born in 1937 in the city of Yozgat, Türkiye. He grew up in a time marked by social and political unrest, which greatly influenced his perspective and his artistic work. Güney was a talented actor, screenwriter and director who began working in the Turkish film industry in the 1960s. His films often addressed social problems, political oppression and the lives of ordinary people. It's fascinating to think about how he incorporated his own experiences and those of those around him into his work.  Güney became known for films such as “Yol” (The Way), which won the Palme d’Or at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. “Yol” tells the story of prisoners who, after their release, return to society and have to overcome the challenges of life in a repressive environment. These themes are not only profound but also very personal for Güney, who himself has often been in conflict with the Turkish regime.  However, his life was marked by controversy and conflict. In the 1970s, Güney was arrested and imprisoned for his political views and criticism of the Turkish government. During this time he wrote many of his best screenplays, which were often written while in prison. I can well imagine him struggling with passion and frustration to get his message out, even when he was physically trapped.  He escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in exile in France until his death. Güney continued his work and continued to fight for the rights of the oppressed and for social justice. His death from stomach cancer in 1984 was a great loss for the Turkish film industry and the cultural scene. It is sad to see that someone who did so much for society died in a moment of weakness and suffering.  In front of his grave I feel the gratitude and respect that many people have for him. His life's work and tireless fight for social justice have a lasting impact on Turkish culture and beyond. The many flowers and messages from fans who came to pay their respects testify to his continued importance as an artist and activist.  Here, in this quiet corner of the famous cemetery, I realize that Yılmaz Güney's life is an inspiring example of the unceasing struggle for freedom and justice. His grave is not only a resting place, but also a symbol of the courage and creativity of a man who fought tirelessly for people's rights and whose voice lives on in art and film.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyNXUzM193RRAB,"Yılmaz managed to pursue higher education in Ankara and then in Istanbul. To make a living, he worked in several small jobs then began with small roles in the cinema. His talents as a screenwriter soon led him to assist the Turkish director Atıf Yılmaz from 1958 to 1961. At the same time, he published some short stories which sent him to prison for 18 months for “communist propaganda”. Upon his release, he played in around forty films where his roles as antiheroes who were victims of social injustice made him very popular with the public.  From 1966, he began directing with Seyyit Han, Wolves Are Hungry and especially Umut (Hope) (1970). In each of his films, Güney's characters move on the slippery slope of harsh daily realities: materially deprived, they also do not have the means to analyze their conditions of existence in the new social and political context of a country where the wealthy often make the law.  In 1971, Güney made six films and the growing success he encountered began to worry the authorities, irritated by the critical tone of his work.  His films most often deal with daily life in the countryside and the oppression that continually falls on the peasants who painfully earn a meager subsistence from the land. It also shows the gap between two worlds, that of the countryside where half of the population still lives and the large modern cities, with their skyscrapers and their slums, which it addresses in particular by depicting the rural exodus and its harsh reality  His characters have precarious and difficult lives but live in the vain hope of a surge towards happiness and social success. They are most often victims of landowners supported by political power. If his films are very realistic, his cinema is characterized by a very aesthetic treatment of dramatic situations.  He was arrested in 1974 for having harbored activists from Mahir Çayan's armed organization, the Türkiye Halk Kurtuluş Partisi-Cephesi, in 1971, on the run after assassinating the Israeli ambassador, Efraim Elrom. He is sentenced to 2 years in prison. Released shortly after thanks to a general amnesty, he immediately made a new film, L'Ami / Comrade, which deals with the role and place of the middle classes in Turkish political life. He then filmed Endişe (The Disquiet) about the lives of seasonal workers in the cotton fields but, following a fight in a bar, he was arrested and sentenced to twenty-four years of hard labor for the murder of a judge. It was never proven that he was the one who fired the fatal bullet. The film is completed by Sheriff Goren, his assistant.  In prison, the filmmaker continued to write: he published three novels, Letters from Prison and asked his friend Zeki Ökten to direct several films for which he wrote the screenplay. After The Herd (Sürü) in 1978 and Düşman (The Enemy) in 1979, Güney, from the depths of his prison, obtained recognition with Yol, the permission in 1982. This film on the story of five prisoners on leave won a immense international success as well as the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Shortly after, Güney managed to escape from prison and took refuge in France where he ended his life in hiding. While in hiding in France, under threat of deportation, he was interviewed by Wim Wenders for Room 666.  In 1983, stripped of his nationality by the Turkish government, he signed his last work, Duvar (The Wall), a film about child prisoners in the Ankara central penitentiary. Accumulating a hundred years of conviction, he sees all his films and writings as well as any public mention of his name banned on Turkish territory.",5 months ago,2024-12-27 19:53:38.078039,5.0,SAITAMAサイタマ,16,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100551597895579334287/reviews?hl=en-GB
