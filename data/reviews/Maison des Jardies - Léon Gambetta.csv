ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKajZXbXNnRRAB,"A place that deserves more frequentation because it feels good there. Basically it is a gardener's house who was lucky enough to meet a (great) man of the caliber of those who strengthened the Republic and who made us live like this today. On a practical level, it's very close to the train station and easy to find. 3 things to do: 1) immediately rename the place “Maison Gambetta”, you will double the number of visitors. Maison des Jardies, magnificent name, doesn't mean anything to anyone (and that's a shame). Sad reality: beautiful novels with bad titles are not read. 2) put one or two benches in the green space behind the statue. It's the kind of place that makes you want to read or ""sit down"" and that would have made me come back, 3) more difficult, move the tenant upstairs who lives at Gambetta's all the same! And show you around this little winter garden as well as its terrace (little café there, why not?) But rest assured, I already know that all this is and will remain on the order of the impossible. In any case, thank you for this dive into his life; there are some who know how to shape their destiny.",a year ago,2025-03-15 23:12:18.373482,5.0,Nicolas Frédéric,341,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115396153862361237562/reviews?hl=en-US

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScjdLMk9REAE,"La Maison des Jardies, or Maison des Illustres, is a residence located in Sèvres in Hauts-de-Seine. First a winegrowers' house then transformed into a country house for Parisians looking to return to nature. Balzac settled in a neighboring chalet from 1838 to 1840. Removed from power, Gambetta occupied it until 1878 when he died there at only 44 years old. This ""secular saint"" is the subject of an annual pilgrimage by the Government but also many foreigners.
