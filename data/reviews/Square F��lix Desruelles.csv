ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGNWZ6TExBEAE,"Vous voyez ce joli petit parc à côté de l' église Saint-Germain des prés, en sortant du métro.  La statue est Bernard Palissy(1510-1590)- Runaissance. French huguenot potter and writer, draughtsman and Painter. Famous for his rustic ceramics, often embellished with realistic elements (reptiles, shells, plants...), applied or modelled in high relief, which were widely imitated at the end of the 19thC.  You can find the work of this great artist at the Louvre Museum ;)  I live near by. It's a small park but my kid loves to play here.  It's honestly a bit sad that the park is dirty.... There are many cafe and street music goin on around the park.
