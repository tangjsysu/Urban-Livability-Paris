The best time to visit is April and May, as featured on my photos. It's a secret place not known to tourists, offering simply enormous space integrated with nature, including ponds and sculptures. There are a few places to eat, a selection of bonsai trees in the pavilion, and peacocks roaming outdoors. Plenty of cute spots for a romantic picnic can be found throughout. There's a large playground space for kids on the further edge of the park, and in autumn, a section of large flower beds features hundreds of dahlia blooms.
