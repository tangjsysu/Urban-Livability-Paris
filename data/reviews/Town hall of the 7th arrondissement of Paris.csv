ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSazR6My13RRAB,"A bureaucratic nightmare at the town hall of the 7th arrondissement of Paris.  It is with immense disappointment and deep bitterness that I share with you my catastrophic experience at the town hall of the 7th arrondissement of Paris for the renewal of my passport. This process, which should have been simple and quick, turned into a veritable bureaucratic hell from which I am still in shock.  As soon as I arrived, I was confronted with an interminable wait, foreshadowing the ordeal that awaited me. Then, once I arrived at the counter, I was confronted by dismissive and incompetent staff who seemed more interested in complicating things than helping me.  And what an aberration this process is! Forms all over the place, documents to be provided, some of which seem to come straight from the Stone Age, and incomprehensible requirements for a simple passport renewal.  Why is everything so complicated in France? In England, this procedure only takes 15 minutes and can be done online! How is it possible that a nation so close geographically and culturally is light years away from ours in terms of efficiency and administrative simplicity?  I am deeply disappointed and angry with this town hall and its labyrinthine administration. I don't wish anyone to have to go through such an ordeal and I sincerely hope that things will move in the right direction.  Mr. Mayor, I urge you to urgently review the organization of your town hall to put an end to this bureaucratic charade which no longer has its place in a modern and developed country like France.",a year ago,2024-12-27 20:57:21.955618,1.0,Louis Benassy,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109258643137794938470/reviews?hl=en

To carry out their work, PETROLES SCHLUMBERGER broke all the Roads rules regarding construction sites, even going so far as to maintain their construction site right on the sidewalk without the slightest authorization.  Alerted, Ms. La Maire wrote that she was taking a stand for my company and that she was immediately intervening with the directors of EIFFAGE and SCHLUMBERGER.
