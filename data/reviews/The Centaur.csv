ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBZ3R1eHVBRRAB,"The ""Centaure"", which the artist César created for Paris, was inaugurated in 1985. He deviates from the classic mythological figure of half man, half horse in essential aspects, deliberately deforming. César Baldacci viewed his work as a homage to Pablo Picasso. It must be understood as a modern interpretation of the legendary creature, which, despite its idiosyncratic elements, manages to express the wild power that was attributed to the Centaur. The artist works with everyday objects for his inspiration. In doing so, he achieves a break with abstraction by promoting reflection on materials, plastic techniques and consumer society. César was one of the New Realists, a group that was also close to Jean Tinguely. Against this background, César's work becomes understandable even for people who are rather unfamiliar with such contractions. It is a work that occurs between aesthetic affirmation and a torn relationship to classical art. Many viewers will perceive it as a gap in their understanding of art. However, there is a memory that remains in their minds that they will grapple with for a long time in order to bridge the gap.",6 years ago,2025-01-24 12:05:32.303897,5.0,A.
