ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwcE5HUmpRRRAB,"JACOBUS VREL EXHIBITION AT THE CUSTODIA FOUNDATION (PARIS)  A dive into the Dutch 17th century  This contemporary artist of Vermeer is presented as his precursor. And the public goes to this mansion on the very chic rue de Lille to find Vermeer there. This is where the trap lies! The comparison does not hold because Vermeer's genius is insurmountable and mysterious and especially because we discover that many other artists painted according to the same references of colors, settings and subjects. It is also one of the interests of this modest (in volume) exhibition to present these other, or almost unknown, artists (Boursse, Gerard ter Borch). Vrel is one of them.  Vrel was “discovered” by a Dutch art historian in 1893. Research began then and to date has not revealed much. This master remains mysterious until his dates of birth and death. Its very name is an enigma appearing nowhere. We cannot identify the places or the cities that he paints (even if experts would have recognized the city of Zwolle in 2021). It adds to the charm! His activity can be verified from the years 1654 to 1662. 45 paintings are attributed to him, 23 of which are presented in Paris.  There we find scenes of life, of the street, of professions, of children playing, of brick facades, of women in their modest interiors busy making pancakes, spinning, chatting among themselves, etc. And, above all this, floats a great melancholic poetry drowned in dark but never disturbing atmospheres. Cats are often present, as are children. A faithful transcription of 17th-century Dutch street life and decor, but marked by the era and its tastes.  The exhibition is not essential due to its brevity and relative originality, but it will suit lovers of this intimate 17th century Dutch work, interested in supplementing their knowledge.
