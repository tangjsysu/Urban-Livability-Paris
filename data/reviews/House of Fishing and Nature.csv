ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbDYtTDh3RRAB,"My 9 year old son spent a 4 day course in this center. When I picked him up on the last day, he didn't look happy. In the evening he told us that in fact, from the first day he was insulted by a boy older than him. On the 2nd day and the last day this same boy hit him. He also allegedly attacked another 6-year-old child. What is scandalous is that a child can slap and insult children in a very vulgar manner under the supervision of the facilitators. My son complained about it to them. The only remark they made to this boy on the last day was to tell him that he was too vulgar. During this course, my son learned swear words that he had never heard before. I was surprised why, when leaving the center, my son refused to let me enroll him in Wednesday/Saturday classes. He told me that one of the hosts said a lot of bad words and that he was too nervous with him, as if he had a grudge against him. The other host, on the contrary, was quite nice.
