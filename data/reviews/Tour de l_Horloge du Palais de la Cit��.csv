ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWamR1ZlBBEAE,"The clock tower is located in the northern corner of the Concierge building, which has been the residence of the Kings of France since 940. The so-called clock tower is massive and rectangular in shape, surmounted by a lantern dating back to 1350, during the reign of John II Le Bon. In 1370, Charles V commissioned Henri le Vic, a clockmaker from Lorraine, to create the clock which was attached to the facade of the tower on the side of the Boulevard du Palais. A year later it was fitted with a silver bell to strike the clock and over time this clock underwent transformations.  They are placed in a place where justice should prevail, and are decorated with symbols of law and justice, which we see today.  During the reign of Henry III, the sculptor Armand Bellon (1528-1590) created new decorations for the clock. The dial is square in shape and decorated with gold rays. The clock is then framed against a starry blue fleur-de-lis background of the royal mantle and harp. The frames are gilded with wreaths. In large minutes, the hands end with a spearhead, and in small hours, with a fleur-de-lis. The tips of the hands end in a crescent. Numbers in Roman letters.  The clock is protected by a round canopy with gilding and boxes, and since its restoration in 2012, this clock appears in all its glory. It is without a doubt a work of art!  It can be reached by ""Cité"" metro station, line 4; Then you should head towards the Palace of Justice and take the street on the right.",a year ago,2024-12-27 21:15:43.218754,5.0,Mohammad Ayoub,230,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102613109672441235778/reviews?hl=en-GB

This iconic tower, also known as the Clock Tower, is a must-visit for anyone interested in medieval architecture and the heritage of Paris.  As I ascended the tower, I was captivated by the stunning views it provided. From the top, I could see panoramic vistas of the city, including famous landmarks such as the Seine River and Notre-Dame Cathedral. The sight was truly breathtaking, and it gave me a new appreciation for the beauty and grandeur of Paris.  Inside the tower, I discovered a wealth of historical artifacts and exhibits that showcased the tower's significance throughout the centuries. From the intricate clock mechanisms to the medieval relics, each item told a story of the tower's past and its role in the daily life of the Palais de la Cité.  One of the highlights of my visit was witnessing the tower's clock in action. The precision and craftsmanship of this timekeeping device were remarkable, and it was fascinating to observe its intricate workings. Hearing the chimes and seeing the mechanisms come to life was a truly memorable experience.  The tour guides at the Tour de l'Horloge were knowledgeable and passionate about the tower's history.

In conclusion, the Tour de l'Horloge du Palais de la Cité is an enchanting destination that offers a unique blend of history, architecture, and breathtaking views.
