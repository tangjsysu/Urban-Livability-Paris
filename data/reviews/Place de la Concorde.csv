ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQblpYRm9RRRAB,"This is an open space with significant history and amazing structures and fountains. This is in between the arc de triomphe (~2 Km) and Louvre museum (~2 km). I recommend one to start at Arc de Triomphe very early and walk from there to Place de la Concorde; as the street leading to this place has all these Fashion houses more importantly, the photographs are going to be awesome. I can spot only south Asians and Asians at this hour as we know we can have a look at the things very peacefully and they will be the least crowded. This may be with greater historic significance but one can fit the visit to this place a few hours before your visit to Louvre Museum. What I did is that my Louvre museum was at 9 AM so I visited this place at 7:30. There is a metro or subway that leads directly to this place; perhaps a few minutes walk. Once you have looked at this place walk all the way through the gardens leading to Louvre museum.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmdXRfU1FnEAE,"Place de la Concorde is one of the most breathtaking and historically significant squares in Paris, and a visit here is an absolute delight. Nestled between the Tuileries Garden and the start of the Champs-√âlys√©es, its central location makes it a convenient stop for anyone exploring the heart of the city. Whether you‚Äôre strolling through Paris or planning a structured sightseeing itinerary, this majestic square offers something for everyone.  The history of Place de la Concorde is as grand as its size. Originally named Place Louis XV, it later became infamous as the site of the guillotine during the French Revolution. The square bore witness to some of the most tumultuous moments in French history, including the execution of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette. Today, it stands as a symbol of unity and peace, as its name suggests, and a tribute to Paris‚Äôs rich cultural legacy.  The highlight of the square is undoubtedly the magnificent Obelisk of Luxor, a 3,300-year-old Egyptian artifact gifted to France in the 19th century. Standing tall at the center of the square, the obelisk is flanked by two beautiful fountains: the Fountain of the Seas and the Fountain of the Rivers, both adorned with exquisite sculptures. The artistry and craftsmanship of these features are truly mesmerizing, making them a perfect backdrop for photographs.  Reaching Place de la Concorde is incredibly easy. The Concorde metro station, served by lines 1, 8, and 12, places you right at the square. For walkers, the location is ideal, as it connects seamlessly with other iconic attractions. You can take a leisurely walk from the Louvre through the Tuileries Garden or continue from here to the Arc de Triomphe via the Champs-√âlys√©es.  What makes Place de la Concorde truly magical is its atmosphere and views. From this open square, you can admire a 360-degree panorama of Paris. The Eiffel Tower peeks from the distance, the grandeur of the Madeleine Church beckons, and the Seine glimmers nearby. Whether you visit during the day or when the city lights shine at night, the square‚Äôs elegance and charm never fail to amaze.  In summary, Place de la Concorde is a harmonious blend of history, art, and beauty. Its accessibility, historical significance, and stunning vistas make it an unmissable highlight of any trip to Paris. It‚Äôs a place where the city‚Äôs past and present come together in perfect harmony.",2 weeks ago,2025-01-24 14:22:10.097750,5.0,Pradeep Mishra,89,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107251463894996438911/reviews?hl=en
