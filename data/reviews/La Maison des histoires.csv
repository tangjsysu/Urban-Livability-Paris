If you want to drink or eat you have to take play time which is relatively short for a child and that's a shame! In the end my son wanted compote and a little cake, I was really rushed and they invited me to quickly go and eat all that outside and not in the bookstore. What I would never have done, I am educated üòâ (to eat in the bookstore).

It's not just someone who reads a book, the ladies are trained in theater, know how to set the tone (it also seemed to me that they knew the text of the book by heart so did not ""read"") and use objects, musical instruments, it's very lively (much better than what you can see in a book reading from an average media library). Small downside, the pirate disguises are quite worn and the ingredients of the cornebidouille soup are better in the presentation video on their site than in reality (spiders and snakes bleached because they are so worn, see photo), the tip of the spear disjointed fire... victims of their success üòâ When children play it is sometimes very noisy to the point that it is difficult to read a story to your own child.
