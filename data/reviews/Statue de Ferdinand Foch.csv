ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzOUxtaHFRRRAB,"Ferdinand Foch (Tarbes, 2 October 1851 ‚Äì Paris, 20 March 1929) was a French general. Foch, a general with a great offensive spirit, capable of planning ambitious strategic operations that often proved impracticable in the concrete reality of trench warfare, was considered the architect of the victory and achieved great prestige throughout the world after the end of the First World War. A technically trained artillery officer, he was among the main theoreticians of the French army in the period preceding the First World War and an advocate of the new aggressive war concepts of the all-out offensive, of the √©lan, of the mistique of the will (the determining importance of will and determination to win in battle). He carried out command roles of great importance during the Great War starting from the first battle of the Marne. After some failures and a temporary loss of influence within the army, in April 1918 he became, by decision of the Entente governments, the commander-in-chief of all Allied armies on the Western Front and conducted the victorious final phase of operations until the surrender of Imperial Germany.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 12:29:16.635598,5.0,daniele pedroni,"1,726",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106356302369543242970/reviews?hl=en

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZcWQ2SVdnEAE,"It is about the famous Trocadero square. You come down from the tower, on which the wind has blown you, you are met by aggressive street sellers of souvenirs, you cross the bridge on foot, then the street and you arrive at Trocadero square. The square is wide with a large fountain and beautiful buildings. It is known for the fact that in 1900 a large world exhibition was held here, in honor of which the Eiffel Tower was built. The tower was conceived as a temporary building, but after a long public debate, it remained forever and became a symbol of the city. You will encounter a lot of tourists at the Trocadero, and from the top of the square there is the most beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower, so this is the ideal place to immortalize your visit to Paris with a camera. Don't miss a ride along the Seine. Once you're on Trocadero, walk towards the bridge that separates this square from the Eiffel Tower and take the stairs down by the bridge to the river. There are tourist boats that will take you along the Seine, where during a one-hour ride you can see, from a different perspective, all the beauties of the central part of Paris (Notre-Dame, beautiful bridges on the Seine, Place de la Concorde, Louvre, etc.). The famous Louvre Museum is also a must-see.
