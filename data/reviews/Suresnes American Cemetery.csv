ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4dmJIalhREAE,"The Suresnes American Cemetery is a beautiful final resting place for more than 1500 Americans who died in during the Great War. Many of those buried here succumbed to their wounds in hospitals in the Paris area, others are victims of the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918 and 1919.  Lying amongst the fallen soldiers and sailors are nurses, civilian volunteers and merchant seamen. The cemetery also contains a small plot containing 24  soldiers, sailors, marines or airmen from the Second World War whose identity is unknown.  Two of the most poignant burials are those of twin sisters Dorothy and Gladys Cromwell, volunteers for the American Red Cross. Depressed after serving at Chalon-sur-Marne and Verdun in 1918 the sisters jumped overboard from the ship taking them back home to America. Their bodies were later washed up and buried side by side at Suresnes.

But the experience is not so great because of the long lines, crowds, and people trying to hawk you post cards and mini Eiffel Towers.  The American Cemetery in Suresnes has none of that.  I spent 45 minutes there and I saw one other person.  It is an emotional, worthwhile visit.  The names and the States makes it personal.  You feel sorry in a way because you know that everyone of them (and there are a number of women because Surnames was a hospital site, not a battle), they all just wanted to go home. Sad.
