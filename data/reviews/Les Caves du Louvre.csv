In fact, we bought two bottles of wine right away and even signed up for the wine and cheese tasting session.  The wine and cheese tasting was very well conducted. The curator again was very impressive with his knowledge. He also shared many stories behind the wine and cheese. The tasting was conducted in a cellar beneath the shop which adds authenticity to the entire experience.  I find the two hours very well spent.  One particular mention is the interaction between the participants. Our group of French, Italian, American and Singaporeans were very active in sharing our own experiences.

This wine cellar is like no other, offering an immersive journey into the world of French wine. It's a perfect blend of education, interactivity, and pure enjoyment that you won't find anywhere else.  The workshop and guided tour provided a comprehensive understanding of the wine-making process, delving into how weather and geology affect the taste of wine. The amount of information presented was seriously impressive, even for someone like me who already knows a bit about wine.  What really stood out about Les Caves du Louvre was their innovative approach to exploring wine. The core samples of different terroirs were mind-blowing, giving you a tangible experience of how the environment shapes the character of a wine. And let's not forget the smelling room with its fun smell quiz game ‚Äì it was a unique and engaging way to learn about wine aromas. I loved how interactive it was!  Throughout the tour, you could tell that the sommelier was incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about French wine. They really made the experience educational and entertaining at the same time. The app they provided was also super helpful, giving you even more information and a personalized touch to the tour.  Les Caves du Louvre is more than just a wine tasting, it's an educational adventure that gives you a deeper appreciation for French wine.
