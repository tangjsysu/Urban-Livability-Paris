ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoODdYaUNBEAE,"Th√©odore G√©ricault was a French artist born September 26, 1791 in Rouen and died January 26, 1824 in Paris.  He is considered the epitome of the romantic artist and his short and tormented life gave rise to many myths.  His most famous work is The Raft of La M√©duse (1818-1819).  G√©ricault was also known for his passion for horses, which he depicted in his paintings, sculptures, lithographs and drawings.",a year ago,2024-12-27 19:55:05.453929,5.0,Pierre Jacob√©e,263,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114579145096154095503/reviews?hl=en-GB

After two years in Italy, he painted The Raft of the Medusa which was a considerable artistic event, linking him to the Romantic movement. He then spent three years in London where he devoted himself to his great passion, horses (the Great Epsom Derby). The sculptor Etex, author of the statue which adorns his tomb, represented him as he was at the end of his life: paralyzed following a fall from a horse, he painted lying down. Three of his works (including the Raft) are represented on the base. Unlike the original painting, the genitals of the dying man in the foreground have been draped, on the sculpture, with a modest veil.",3 years ago,2024-12-27 19:55:05.454929,5.0,Curtis Newton,144,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106202156510378136571/reviews?hl=en-GB
