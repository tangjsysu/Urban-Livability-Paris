The exhibition I wanted to see today was in one hot stuffy overcrowded and not really well ventilated room in the basement. You have to pay the entrance fee for the whole museum so it was quite a rip-off. They use the fact that they are located in the Marais.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlMjZEMndBRRAB,"I’ve been a fan of HCB for many years and his work has been incredibly influential on mine. So it was a treat to visit. It’s a small intimate space with changing exhibits. However, I was not impressed with the quality of the prints. I’ve seen his original prints (at least those made under his direction in his later years and also that were signed) and the ones for the exhibit looked like they had been scanned from the original negatives and printed recently. These have a different look than the Agfa Brovira paper used in the 1970’s. There there also no early vintage prints (from the 1930’s etc) which would have been small and made primarily for book and magazine reproductions In addition these images are too clean and all imperfections had been removed as though in Photoshop (dust, scratches etc). Finally, some of these are also printed quite muddy in tones.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZeWZDSkhnEAE,"As a street photography lover I made a pilgrimage visit to this museum. I suppose this should be a must go place for any street photographers visiting Paris. However, the museum is a total scam. Only very few work of HCB is being displayed, and they are presented in a tiny room (about 250 square feet, equivalent to a large hotel room), and they call this a museum. The most famous work of HCB is not even shown. Almost half of the space of the “museum” is dedicated to the work of another photographer (who captured some random shots of the streets in Africa). Great. To justify for the high price I paid for visit, I circulated the room twice, hoping desperately to find a magical doorway that might perhaps lead to a larger show room.
