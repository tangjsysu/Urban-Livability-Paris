ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2ejZHdEhnEAE,Raphael was an outstanding tour guide. He was very knowledgeable and shared interesting information in a concise format. We did a 2 hr tour and saw all the highlights and had the opportunity to stop and take pictures while Raphael provided context. He was extremely professional and courteous and he arrived promptly according to our arrangements. Excellent way to explore Paris while winding down the back cobblestone streets. Highly recommend his small company. Well done!!,a week ago,2024-12-28 15:42:53.764966,5.0,michelle kane,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102824776035391684308/reviews?hl=en-GB
