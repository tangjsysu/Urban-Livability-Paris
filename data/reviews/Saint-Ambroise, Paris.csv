ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNFdThIaXFnRRAB,We flew from Texas to Paris two days after Notre Dame burned so our plans to attend Easter Mass at Notre Dame didn't happen. Instead we picked Saint-Ambroise to celebrate Easter services and a surprise Baptism. Very friendly parish. I was sitting on the end of the pew so I had my first experience of the famous French cheek kissing. A very nice elderly lady with white hair walked down the aisle cheek kissing everyone at the end of each pew. I was nervous but I think I passed.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsMjlQYmlnRRAB,"What a great discovery the Saint-Ambroise Church in Paris is! It is a place steeped in history and spirituality. I was impressed by its majestic architecture and its magnificent stained glass windows which let in divine light.  The interior of the church is equally captivating, with its detailed carvings and colorful frescoes. I felt an atmosphere of serenity and contemplation while walking through its alleys.  The Saint-Ambroise Church is a true jewel of the 11th arrondissement of Paris. It is dedicated to Saint Ambrose and gave its name to the surrounding district. With its 87 meters in length and its 68 meters in height, it is truly impressive.  If you are looking for a moment of peace and contemplation, I highly recommend visiting the Church of Saint-Ambroise. It is a place where you can recharge your batteries and connect to your spirituality.  In conclusion, my visit to Saint-Ambroise Church was an enriching and inspiring experience.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURseGV6cGZBEAE,"Classified as a historical monument, the church was built shortly after 1860. Absolutely worth a visit. You will be amazed by the beautiful atmosphere that can be felt thanks to the clever lighting, the large nave and the side niches of the various saints. The organ above the entrance door is magnificent. Go beyond the altar and you will discover a very intimate space dedicated to the Madonna, a nice surprise!",a year ago,2024-12-27 20:20:04.348965,5.0,maria ficetti,308,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103229439210013067144/reviews?hl=en
