ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzcnFxUXd3RRAB,"Simply shameful  Today was my grandfather's funeral. There were two of us writing a text and the priest started to say “it’s not too long I hope” “ah it’s double-sided?? » then a man who was high up said ""what the hell"" even though my text was only 2 minutes long and the other person's text which had to be shortened was no more than 3. In this moment of mourning and the last message that we could give to my grandfather, I became angry at the enormous lack of respect he showed us. Moreover, when I started to read my text I heard the priest say “I have never seen that” really no empathy in this moment which is so important for us. I don't understand why he would agree to do this mess if he didn't even have 5 minutes to let us talk.",a month ago,2024-12-27 20:51:00.072348,1.0,Alicia Harre,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110920044460633449260/reviews?hl=en-GB
