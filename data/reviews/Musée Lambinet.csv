ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0cnZ5WXZnRRAB,I love these little museums off the beaten track. Small and quiet but still interesting. Lovely collection of paintings and objects. Peronally I loved the period rooms. It gives you a good idea of what these houses looked like in the past as most of the wood panelling is still in tact.

Very well documented events for the French Revolution and a portrait of Miss Charlotte Corday who murdered Marat for the right reasons. Coupled with a visit to the Mus√©e Picasso in Paris, good to see the portrait of this unusual killer. Then the events which saw Napoleon‚Äôs rise etc are also very well documented.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3N3VpNzFRRRAB,Nice small museum.  The signage is only in French so if you do not read the language plan to just enjoy the paintings and items for their beauty and historical interest.
