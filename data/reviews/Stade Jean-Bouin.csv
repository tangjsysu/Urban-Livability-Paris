ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2OGRlMTNRRRAB,We were lucky enough to experience this extraordinary rugby and women's FC stadium during Nuit Blanche when it was open to the public. This visually striking piece of architecture with it's exceptional web-like facade is a marvel to behold from the outside. From the inside this feature continues as an overhang for the stands and appears as a gently undulating wave around the entire perimeter of the building. Our experience was made all the more fantastic having the vantage point from the middle of the playing field allowing a complete view of the entire venue. This stadium is more intimate than Parc de Princes as the seating capacity is just less than half of that facility.,3 years ago,2025-01-24 14:02:37.688620,5.0,Kate Ruby,145,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114796395554864350479/reviews?hl=en
