ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNka04zZzR3RRAB,Such an amazing visit. Was unaware of the tragedy that befell the family and to have a glimpse into their world was really a humbling experience.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxMXBLNjdRRRAB,Kind of disappointing museum as nothing was in English and everything seemed very faded.  There wasn‚Äôt a single room that made you say ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù. Paled in comparison to similar places like the Wallace Museum or the Mauitshuis or period rooms generally. Not worth the trip.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKbjdyTTB3RRAB,"Beautiful, well preserved town palace built early 20th century by Count Mo√Øse de Camondo who was a banker.  The town palace was inspired by the Little Trianon at the palace in Versailles and built on the location of the town palace of his parents.  The whole interior is frozen in time since 1935 when Camondo died and donated it in his last will to Paris's Decorative Arts Society  It's great to wonder through the beautiful decorated rooms and even the kitchen has some interesting details.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMDYtVUZnEAE,"So, nice museum, however very disappointed. I went to visit it because scenes from the tv show Lupin were shot there. So I thought at least I would see a couple references to that, like the traditional Ars√®ne Lupin‚Äôs costume, a few pictures from the show in the rooms they shot from, etc . I mean this series is known worldwide and is very well loved...  free marketing for the museum, so u would think they‚Äôd take advantage of it.

I took my time and perused everything. It‚Äôs difficult for me to pick one thing as a favorite as everything is exquisite. The tragedy of this former home of the Camondo family is when listening to the audio guide Moise Camondo bequeathed the home to France upon his death. Sadly except for his son killed in WW1 his whole family, being Jewish, was turned over to the nazis and exterminated.
