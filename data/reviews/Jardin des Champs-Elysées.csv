It's good to buy a ticket online with a time slot in advance and then just go straight to the entrance skipping all that huge queue in front of ticket office. As for gardens from April you need to pay additional ‚Ç¨10, (‚Ç¨9 for kids) to see it. The gardens plus parc are huge so if you are tired of walking you can just rent a golf car or wait for a little train that goes to all interesting sites.
