ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIX3RuX1dnEAE,"Small tree-lined square with children's play area. Plane trees, Crimean lime trees and yews shade the remains of the foundations of the Liberty Tower, one of the eight towers of the Bastille. This fortress, which was partly located on the current Place de la Bastille, marked the Saint-Antoine gate located at the level of the so-called Charles V enclosure. The Bastille, a state prison, was stormed on the 14th. July 1789 by the revolutionaries, then dismantled from 1790. It was during the construction of the first metro line linking Vincennes to Place de l'Etoile that the remains of this tower were unearthed in 1899, rue Saint-Antoine. They were moved and reassembled here stone by stone. The square is dedicated to the journalist and writer Henri Galli, pseudonym of Henri Gallichet (1854-1922), municipal councilor of the 4th arrondissement from 1900 to 1919 and deputy for the Seine from 1914 to 1922.",3 months ago,2024-12-28 15:22:10.108091,4.0,Laurent Padou,850,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102878442016850755868/reviews?hl=en
