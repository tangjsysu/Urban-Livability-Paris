ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJX3ZUX0JnEAE,"Recently spent a week in Paris and enjoyed seeing the July Column (Colonne de Juillet) at Place de la Bastille again. This is a 47 metre tall column monument that was erected in the centre of the plaza between 1835-40.  Previously the location of the infamous Bastille Prison which was destroyed during the early days of the French Revolution. What you find here is a bronze column, topped by a gilded figure - the Genius of Liberty'. The base of the column includes decorative bas-reliefs which are not easy to see from afar.  Unfortunately, the monument is surrounded by a busy roundabout, making it less convenient to view up close. However, you can have a good look from the street intersections that lead to the square.  In the end, an impressive monument but not easy to view from up close.
