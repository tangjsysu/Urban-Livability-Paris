ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiLUtqZmVnEAE,My 2 kids (1 and 2 years old) loved the park. They have 2 different parks one for kids under 4 and the other big park (small kids can also go but they have to enter with an adult). I paid 22 euros for the 2 kids and for me. Also take into account you and your kids must have socks to enter (if by any chance you go without they sell). Also you may not take food or drinks inside but you can buy thing's in the inside.,5 months ago,2024-12-27 19:30:09.580637,5.0,Sara Villegas,306,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116867658308826913189/reviews?hl=en-GB

And for the toilet its not child friend, the need to put more kid size toilet and sink for them to wash their hand and the toilet is not also well ventilated.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZa3RlUndRRRAB,"It is not a very big place as I imagined.  I was feeling claustrophobic as it was fully crowded. However both my kids had a great time.  They just played to their heart's desire and enjoyed ball pit, climbing frames, slides, crawling through tunnels, zip line etc. The staff members were present at many places throughout the playarea. There were some paid rides too and some paid machine games too. The food in the restaurant was very basic fast food.  No baby food was available. There is no supermarket around this place so must carry your own baby food.  Picnics are not allowed and you must wear only socks inside which is kind of good thing.  Toilets were ok. There were water spills at some places so it was very inconvenient for using toilets while wearing just socks, from hygiene point of view not a great thing. Giving it 4 stars as kids had a superb fun time.",5 years ago,2024-12-27 19:30:09.580637,4.0,pragya pant,106,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105985921747305319326/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDZzhhalBREAE,"This was a nice playground for children. The staff were amazing. Very caring and supportive. My child enjoyed his time thoroughly in this place. I felt the place was a bit small and many of the games were dependent on change rather than free to children to play. Compared to other places I've been to, the facilities in this place were little and very commercially profit-based rather than accessible child friendly games especially in light of the small number of facilities and games",4 years ago,2024-12-27 19:30:09.581637,4.0,Nibras Aldibbiat,318,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118345496917841835151/reviews?hl=en-GB
