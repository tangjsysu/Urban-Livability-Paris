ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURueUpPWGxRRRAB,"Visiting Paris October 3. All the museums have crazy long lines. So decided to go to Auteuil to see some steeplechase horse races. Getting there from the subway is about a 15 min walk from Port D’Auteuil Metro station along a beautiful park trail. The races were wonderful. Beautiful track, handsome horses.
