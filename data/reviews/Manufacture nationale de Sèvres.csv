ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2ejZ1S0JBEAE,"DO NOT GO!!!  Despite being fully vaccinated, with my valid double vaccination CDC card from the USA, the horribly “bureaucratic” staff — except 1 out of half a dozen: 1 professional, even if unable to “help”, others unimaginably unprofessional, and rude — both the website and in person “provide” miscommunication, and lack of information to the visiting public, about requirements to enter: only French QR “pass sanitaire” ‘accepted’ (unable to obtain ahead of time, despite having requested information from the embassy many weeks ago, before traveling to France, nor here in person, also due to a lack of larger clearer and understandable governmental guidelines, once HERE, as to where/how to obtain one; and/or ridiculous to imagine that each and every place would require a new PCR test every 72 hours!!!). NO OTHER PLACE IN FRANCE, PARIS IN PARTICULAR, CREATED THIS PROBLEM, and no other museum, exhibition, or restaurant, either public, or private space, required this in over a month here in France. UTTERLY UNACCEPTABLE!  Update after two weeks: REFUND for paid tickets still not received!!! Equally UNACCEPTABLE!!!  UPDATE 2: The ""reply"" received, does not address the rudeness and lack of professionalism and lack of accurate information on half a dozen (yes, 6!) employees at the Museum... AND, a REFUND from the museum still has not been issued. The standard ""refer[ing] to the law"" response lacks the appropriate reply regarding the above (unprofessional and rude attitudes of the staff, minus one who was professional and sympathetic towards the issues at hand). THE QR CODE requirement is NOT (at the time we checked) mentioned as being the ONLY ACCEPTABLE means to access the museum. AND, effectively, THIS MUSEUM is accusing ALL THE OTHER FRENCH INSTITUTIONS we had visited during one whole month as 'breaking the law"" per their response!

Many pieces of ceramics and some glass pieces too, the museum is abobe average when it comes to the quality, age and number of the art pieces, especially when comparing to Louvre as an example or other eputable ceramics museums across Europe, there are some very nice pieces here but the collection is a bit limited however in comparison with other specific museums, very close however. Do not understand the above wrong the collection is huge and has many nice pieces just that there are a couple of other European museums that top this one.
