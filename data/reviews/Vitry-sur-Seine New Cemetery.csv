ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmNUt2NUh3EAE,"I only give one star because I have no choice but to go there. What a shame, having such incompetent staff without know-how or know-how. They work in a cemetery, are probably civil servants and serving the public and have no empathy. On the other hand, they have contempt... This December 24, I traveled 600 km to see my mother for the first time who died only 3 months ago. With my father, I simply wanted to drop off his long-awaited photo for Christmas... I arrive at 3:45 p.m., the employee tells me to refuse my entry because the cemetery closes at 4:00 p.m. So I point out to him that it is not yet 4 p.m. and that I only need 5 minutes no more because I am going back to my region. He doesn't really care, despises me, doesn't deign to come near to talk to me. I am asking him for this service especially since no display mentions this closure. The employee looks at me, tells me that's how he must close, then leaves, leaving me at the gate facing our solitude. A shame. Thank you, this behavior is lamentable and unworthy.",a day ago,2024-12-27 20:05:40.307894,1.0,Ludovic Irles,39,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110278676760491445226/reviews?hl=en-GB
