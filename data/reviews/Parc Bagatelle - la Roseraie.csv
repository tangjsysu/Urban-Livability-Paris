ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYOTh1UnBnRRAB,It's a hidden gem I must say in the heart of Paris. It's clean but as there is some peacocks so it makes the garden a but dirty. But it's a worth visit in the summer days. A large scale places with numerous ponds with beautiful attractions of the French history.  There is Public toilets and proper bus stands near by this park. It's a well maintained place.in summer the rose garden becomes more beautiful and the scenic view blooms everywhere in this park. It's wheel chair accessible and nice tracks for jogging and walking for every age of persons. Just recommended for visitors who wants to see some natural views. It's better to come in the early morning time because that time we can enjoy the most gorgeous views of the animals here.,3 months ago,2025-01-24 14:05:22.038413,5.0,Tanzila Hasan Pinky,195,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103754392615617077520/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cU9IdGVBEAE,"A charming park on the outskirts of Paris, about 15-20 minute stroll from the line 1 metro station at Pont de Neuilly. Calm, sunny, has an amazing rose garden (late May-June and September blooming), featuring lots of curious peacocks that would follow you around and display their fanciful plumage.
