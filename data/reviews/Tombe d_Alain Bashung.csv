ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoODV1Yzd3RRAB,"Alain Bashung, born December 1, 1947 in the 14th arrondissement of Paris and died in the same city on March 14, 2009, is a French singer-songwriter and actor.  After a difficult start to his career, he found success in the early 1980s with songs such as Gaby oh Gaby and Vertige de l'amour, becoming a reference on the French scene.  From his eighth album, Osez Jos√©phine (1991), he produced more titles with less commercial impact, which did not prevent them from being praised by critics and his public. He has released twelve studio albums and two posthumous albums.",a year ago,2024-12-27 20:02:13.259472,5.0,Pierre Jacob√©e,263,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114579145096154095503/reviews?hl=en-GB
