ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsbHZldDB3RRAB,"A beautiful and tranquil place to sit and reflect. The entire building is a wonder and a fine example of stonemasonry, carpentry, and fine artwork. The only disappointment was a woman taking advantage of visitors who are likely to be charitable Christians. She was a middle aged respectable looking lady approaching all who were in the church asking for money because she had an unwell grandchild. I was not convinced of her genuine plight. It lowered the tone of what the building represents.",a year ago,2025-01-24 13:41:24.731565,5.0,C B,27,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102051360918071035119/reviews?hl=en-GB
