ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNadnRfdDB3RRAB,I am an American here. My group from school came here to learn more about Europe. This is coming from a girl who knew nothing about the European Nation and now has a broader spectrum on how the European nation works.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYZ0pySnFRRRAB,"As part of an outing with young people (17-18 years old), we went to this center and spent a good afternoon there. We were well received and well guided by the staff, who were generally friendly. We went to the role-playing space, to put ourselves in the shoes of MEPs. This space is modern and spacious. Several rooms and touch screens are available to visitors. The role play allowed us to put ourselves in the shoes of MEPs belonging to different political groups, and to vote on laws, more specifically related to water management and the implantation of microchips.  It was necessary to take into account the opinions of European citizens, debate, convince, answer questions from fake journalists... Each participant had a telephone on which instructions indicated the actions they had to carry out. It was an enriching experience, even if a little long too...!
