ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJdHNmUWdRRRAB,"Square Barye is a small triangular shaped public park at the southeastern tip of Ile Saint Louis in the middle of the Seine River. Inaugurated in 1938 on the location of a former monastery which was torn down around 1840, what you will find today are a handful of park benches, children's playground section and views of the Seine splitting to the north and south of the island.  The most interesting thing to see here is the feature monument created by French sculptor Laurent Marqueste and dedicated to Antoine Louis Barye. The monument features two side statues of male figures in classical pose, a bronze lion at the monument front as well as a bronze statue of what appears to be Hercules battling a centaur at the top of the monument. It's an in interesting attraction to see in an otherwise small park.",5 years ago,2024-12-27 21:30:15.146480,3.0,Brad,"5,430",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB
