ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4anNfdGZnEAE,"It's a beautiful and well managed museum. The works of art are beautifully displayed. It would be an emotional experience for me as I am Jewish if I  better understood what I was looking at. I was very impressed with the quality.  Unfortunately there were two problems that ruined my visit. They've made little accommodation for English speakers. The art and cultural descriptions surprisingly are only in French. If they didn't want to go to the expense to provide multiple languages on the numerous plaques, they could have provided an online translation or printed materials. In addition the speakers that provide translation of many pieces and displays by number do not have most of the numbers displayed. I tried guessing based on the order of the rooms but that didn't work.

Contrary to many local Jewish history museums this museum doesn't exclusively depicts the history of the French or Parisian Jews, but tries to show us the history of all the Jews globally. In the Musee d'art et d'histoire du Judaisme you will also have a lot of interesting objects surrounding the history of the noneuropean Jews, like photographs from Indian Jews and artpieces from Jews from Algeria.

We went to the ticket office and the person there was even more rude and we figured out that they didn't even give us headphones with the tickets for the temporary exhibition, that's how the guards upstairs knew to not let us in. Again, we paid full price and this exhibition was included in the price, they just didn't want to let us in because 'it was all in French'.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4czhLc2x3RRAB,"It would be easy to miss the entrance to the MAHJ on Temple St. just north of Rambuteau, especially when Temple below Rambuteau is so busy. The security is very tight as you'd expect, with metal detectors and isolated walkthrough rooms (i.e.: so only one person at a time can get through and into the main museum are).  Once inside, the stark yet very tranquil courtyard with a single status of a French (i would imagine Jewish as well) solider with a broken sword greets you. From there you progress to the main building behind the statue. The building(s) have been beautifully restored and update. The traditional white limestone merged newer construction techniques were of interest alone and are not what one would expect in a museum of this character.  The exhibit itself walks you through a variety of Jewish artifacts and their connection to Jewish history...like priest robes, torahs and even synagogues.. At the end is the connection between France and Judaism with an emphasis on the Dreyfuss Affair...which I knew of but this was in-depth including artifacts from the time. Very interesting!  If you want to learn a little more on Jewish history and artifacts and it's connection to France this would be a good experience. It is also a very peaceful break from a hectic part of Paris. Enjoy!
