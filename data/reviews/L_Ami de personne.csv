ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzMnVXSWVREAE,"This sculpture in the Tuileries Gardens is called Nobody's Friend (L'Oeuvre L'Ami de Personne) and is the work of Swedish sculptor Erik Dietman and was installed in 1999.  What you see is a bronze of a vague and peculiar shaped creature with certain humanoid features as well as what seems like a small seat. It is a quirky find in the Tuileries Garden, potentially worth finding if you enjoy viewing abstract sculptures.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 11:30:57.238593,3.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURsekw2aVBREAE,Interesting work composed of a statue with a confusingly humanoid shape and an empty chair facing it. When we see it we turn around to understand it better. We can see an outstretched hand depending on its position.
