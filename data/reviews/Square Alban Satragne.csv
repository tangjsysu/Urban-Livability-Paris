ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1M2J2YjN3RRAB,"Square boulevard landscaped and landscaped. Redevelopment in 2020, this garden has a clear and symmetrical perspective, known as French style, on the Saint-Lazare chapel and its raised square. The central, pedestrian alley invites you to stroll around the two pools and the mosaic fountain by Jean-Luc Giraud installed since 1990. All around and at the entrances unfold, creating a setting, shrubby groves and rows of trees bringing freshness and shade. As part of the old and vast Clos Saint-Lazare, the history of the garden is closely linked to that of the Fran√ßoise Sagan media library. From a leper colony in the 12th century, the site was acquired in the 17th century by the Congregation of the Mission of the Vincentians and its founder Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Prison at the Revolution, hospital-prison for women Until 1930, then Saint-Lazare hospital Until 1998, the media library opened in 2015.",a year ago,2025-01-24 12:34:41.202456,4.0,Laurent Padou,852,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102878442016850755868/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDN2JHN1NREAE,"It reopened after a year and a half of construction. The park has grown larger and chairs are placed everywhere. The stupid little park for kids has just a few changes to the play equipment. Long-term construction using ward taxes. . Honestly, I'm not sure what they wanted to do, except that the overall design of the park has changed slightly. I would like the park to have a park manager on hand, to have proper public restrooms instead of simple ones, to make the children's playground more spacious and have more play equipment, and to make the whole park more full of nature. This park is still occupied by vagrants and delinquents, and nothing has changed from before. The purpose was to change and renew that atmosphere, but it is very disappointing. Even if it's a shortcut to go to the library, I don't really want to take it.
