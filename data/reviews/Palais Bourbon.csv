ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0aG96RGxBRRAB,"The centre of parliamentary life, the Assembl√©e Nationale seats 577 members of parliament who represent the French people. It legislates and controls the actions of the government, adopting some 100 laws per year. The Palais Bourbon, finished in 1728, was built for the Duchess of Bourbon by architects Giardini, Aubert, and Gabriel. The structure therefore evokes that of the Grand Trianon de Versailles. It was then updated by the Prince of Cond√© between 1765 and 1789. Declared as ‚Äòproperty of the people‚Äô in 1791, the Palais Bourbon had many different uses and had a national representation from 1795 with the Council of Five Hundred. The colonnade on the fa√ßade dates back to the Napoleonic era. The building‚Äôs transformation continued throughout the 19th century, particularly with the help of painter, Delacroix. Today, the Palais also displays numerous works of contemporary art. Since November 2012, the Palais Bourbon has been open every week to individual visitors (public entrance at 33 Quai d‚ÄôOrsay). Guided tours take place on Saturday (during Assembly) or open visits are available Monday to Saturday (during periods of adjournment). Due to security reasons, visitors that have booked their visit in advance should arrive at least 15 minutes before the start of the tour. If not, their place can be offered to another visitor. Those who have not booked beforehand may also arrive at least 15 minutes before the start of the tour: they will be offered any available spaces on the tour. Adults must provide an ID (national identity card or passport). Proper attire is required (long sleeves in particular).",5 years ago,2025-01-24 13:34:57.306510,5.0,nima farhadi,134,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117372309136404045915/reviews?hl=en-GB
