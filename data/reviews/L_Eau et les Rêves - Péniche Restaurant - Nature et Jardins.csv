ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIeXRLcjZBRRAB,We loved this riverboat‚Ä¶ Go here to grab a cup of coffee or a drink. Wonderful atmosphere. Enjoyed ourselves!,4 months ago,2025-01-24 11:52:07.491992,5.0,Terri L,239,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102538653281343918795/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cnFqb1pREAE,"The place is nice and unique, the library downstairs is cool and all the plants make the space cosy. The drinks were fine and not so expensive. Although in general the staff was really polite, there was this lady serving at the bar that changed our whole perception of the place. She was being impatient and rude for no apparent reason, made us want to leave sooner.  At some point one of us realized they lost their wallet and the bar lady started pressuring us strongly to pay even though we showed no sign of trying to leave without paying. We felt uncomfortable and more pressured than we already were.",2 years ago,2025-01-24 11:52:07.493154,3.0,Zoe Gonz√°lez,16,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111348347490977882904/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsX29XSGtnRRAB,"Edit from April 2024: Big fan of this barge, I was very disappointed with the service my last time. We had reservations three days in advance, we had to call 6 times before someone picked up. Arriving there, we were told that all the tables were already reserved, and in fact no, after discussion with another server we realized that our reservation had been taken into account. We had to pay for all drinks in advance, standing at the door before being able to sit down. The welcome was less top-notch and friendly as before...  Old review: We came to eat brunch on Sunday. The cheesecake is delicious and everything is homemade (lemonade, iced tea, cakes etc.). The bun was incredibly good, and so huge that I had trouble finishing it all! The price-quality ratio is really ideal. The atmosphere is super chill, the waiters are super friendly and the setting is magnificent, a bit vintage with lots of plants everywhere. In short, it was a great experience and I will come back without any hesitation!",8 months ago,2025-01-24 11:52:07.494228,4.0,Camille B.,26,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104604986168319336208/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdW82ZXF3RRAB,"Disappointing brunch because ultimately expensive for the quantity of product we have.
