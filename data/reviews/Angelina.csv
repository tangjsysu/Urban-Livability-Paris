ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmMTluRmxBRRAB,"I know this place is already too renowned however I still want to leave a review. I came alone without reservation and waited for around 40 minutes in Sunday afternoon.  The bites were so much fun, the hot chocolate was remarkably rich in flavour, the interior is undoubtedly pretty.  However, the best thing I experienced here is their service, they were so nice and caring to me, I dined there alone but they made me feel not lonely at all!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmNjRXbmV3EAE,We came for the hot chocolate that has been raved about online. It was well worth the wait. The hot chocolate is very chocolate and creamy.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2Z0lPbHp3RRAB,"I came here for breakfast with family. We ordered the brunch, the Angelina omelette, and a mocha. The brunch was nice, but nothing exceptional. They give a generous amount of coffee with the brunch. However, only give a single cup, and when asked for a second, they refused, forcing us to share a cup for no conceivable reason other than hoping we would waste 5 euros to buy a second coffee. The omelette was very disappointing. They use an obscene amount of butter when cooking it, ensuring the only flavour present is butter. The mocha was delicious, I was tempted to give the restaurant 4 stars just for this. However, the mediocrity of the brunch and the disapoint that was the omelette were my biggest take always. The interior of the restaurant is certainly 5 stars. The atmosphere is fantastic. I would come here again just to sit and drink a mocha.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzcDd6Zi13RRAB,"My sister wanted me to get her some things from here while in Paris because it is known for the viral hot chocolate. We ended up visiting twice. The queue for the restaurant was much smaller at 10am. It was pretty long at 3pm. However if you just want the shop, you don‚Äôt have to wait in that long queue as that‚Äôs only for getting a table. Personally I thought the hot chocolate did live up to the hype. It was so incredibly thick and tasty.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmMnFEcmd3RRAB,"I stayed at Hotel Brighton which is next door and I have the benefit to wake up early and not experience the queue. Almost at any time, there is a queue of 20-30 people getting into the restaurant. I was there one day at about 8am and I was given a table immediately. I was here for breakfast, and we had an eggs benedict and a brioche with scrambled eggs and bacon. The food was good given its expectations. Service was overall quick. The internal deco of the restaurant is classy but not imposing. Tables are really small so it's not really for people who orders a lot of dishes to share.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmakstNVlBEAE,Husband and I were in town for the Christmas markets and saw this was close by. I mostly stopped by to check in on this hot chocolate hype and to try pastries. We waited for about 20 minutes to get a seat. Service was really quick. The total time from stepping into the line to stepping out of the door was an hour. The hot chocolate was good but nothing special. I've lived in Belgium for almost 5 years and this is how the majority of the hot chocolate is here. The desserts were good.

The food looks good but the taste was just OK, nothing special, and while the chocolate drink was rich, it was too sweet for my taste. For me, it was a one-time experience, definitely just a hype.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmM3BpQzBnRRAB,"Came here for the hot chocolate as it went viral. It was super rich and although I came alone, the portion was enough for 2 cups. I found it difficult to drink so much of the richness so sharing it with someone would be perfect. They also adjusted the amount of whipped cream for one. I ordered a croissant too and I loved dipping it into the chocolate.  I saw tables around me get the croissant scrambled eggs and I must say the portion compared to the price doesn‚Äôt seem right to me but maybe it‚Äôs filling or the taste makes up for it. There are lots of set menus/combos I would‚Äôve tried but for one it would be too much.  Note: I came on Christmas and it was a 30-45 min wait to get seated which isn‚Äôt bad for a holiday for this place.  Overall, I don‚Äôt recommend coming alone as it‚Äôs not worth the wait, but with a group of 2-4 and ordering stuff to share feels like it would be a great time.",,2025-01-24 14:15:08.833583,,Canice Hong,25,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110478884945860332075/reviews?hl=en
