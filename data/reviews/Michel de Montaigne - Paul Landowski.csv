ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdHVlOXFRRRAB,"Just beyond Mus√©e de Cluny in the Sorbonne quarter is the small monument filled Square Paul-Painlev√©. One of the interesting statues to see here is that of Michel de Montaigne.  This statue is a bronze depiction of the 16th-century French philospher in a siting position with legs crossed and arms folded. He is dressed in period attire and appears to be in deep thought.  Do notice one shiny shoe of the Michel de Montaigne statue. This is from visitors rubbing for good luck and success, a tradition that stems back many years from the local university touching the shoe of Montaigne before important exams.  You can view the Michel de Montaigne and other statues at Square Paul-Painlev√© in 10-15 minutes before or after your visit to the museum, then carry on with other intended sightseeing in the area.",5 years ago,2024-12-27 21:11:28.332983,3.0,Brad,"5,430",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzOUpiZWxRRRAB,"Michel de Montaigne was a French philosopher, writer, politician and aphorist (1533-1592). In front of the Sorbonne, on the side of the rue des Ecoles, near the square Paul Painlev√®, there is the statue of Montaigne which has a curious peculiarity: the right foot, like Juliet's breast in Verona, or Victor Noir's sex in Pere Lachaise, it seems to have been worn by many hands. The bronze statue dating back to 1933 replaced a stone statue of Montaigne himself. The story goes that all wishes made by caressing the writer's right foot and pronouncing the phrase ""SALUT MONTAIGNE"" are granted. It seems that the origin of this act is simply student superstition.",a month ago,2024-12-27 21:11:28.334983,5.0,daniele pedroni,"1,662",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106356302369543242970/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBZ29lcXdnRRAB,"Since 1933, Michel de Montaigne has been enthroned as a sculpture by the sculptor Paul Landowski on the small, shady Paul Painlev√© square at the entrance to the Sorbonne. A superstition that students should actually be averse to because it corresponds to magical thinking has always led them to touch Montaige's shoe before exams and say ""Salut Montaigne"" that it would bring them luck and success. Originally made of white marble, this sculpture was damaged due to this tradition. In 1989 it was replaced by a new version in bronze. The shoe on the left foot of the crossed legs shows a bright shine today because of the many touches. It is a vivid sculpture that depicts the great thinker, philosopher of the Renaissance and writer, whose works are still widely read today, as a mature personality. Unusually, Montaigne grew up speaking Latin as his tutor Horstanus, a doctor from Germany, spoke neither French nor the Gascon language common in the area. His parents also acquiesced to the situation and spoke Latin with the boy at home. Montaigne himself viewed his upbringing as an experiment by his father, who, following the example of Erasmus of Rotterdam, pursued a humanist education with him. On this basis, Montaigne's life was shaped and initiated his career. For the Sorbonne students, the sculpture is more than just a physical representation; they see it as a worthy role model. A pleasant idea that Montaigne, with his humanistic way of thinking, still has an influence on people today.",6 years ago,2024-12-27 21:11:28.338984,5.0,A.
