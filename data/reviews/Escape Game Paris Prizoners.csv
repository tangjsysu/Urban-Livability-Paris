ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMnNhc0h3EAE,"We did the room ""Le cabaret des deux mondes"", an adventure which takes place in 1911. We were totally immersed in this spatio-temporal fault both in terms of decor and atmosphere. It is indeed one of the most accomplished settings that I have seen among the multiple escape games that I have been able to do. I recommend 100%. The only downside is the end photo, it would be necessary to provide a location in the setting that does not spoil things, rather than a photo taken in front of a background that in no way represents the adventure experienced.",2 years ago,2024-12-27 19:45:36.158136,5.0,Gavin Job,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109127492151842224554/reviews?hl=en

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNTR1SUdREAE,"Being passionate about escape games, I have never had an experience like that of this Sunday, January 29, 2023. We arrived on time at the Prizoners premises.  We played the Le Cabaret des deux mondes venue. As we arrived in the last room, we heard a noise. Then leaving this last room, we returned to the first room of the adventure and we came across a team starting their game and receiving a briefing from a game master. We looked at each other for a few seconds. The game master of this team ordered us: ‚Äúgo back to the reception hall!‚Äù Come back up! "". He was visibly embarrassed and so were we because the team had seen the last piece of the adventure from the start because of this lack of organization. This noisy and abrupt end to the game also spoiled some of our fun.  Especially since we discovered that this other team had been given a video briefing, unlike us. The story was presented to us orally by our Game-master while the video we saw seemed much more immersive and dynamic and we would have liked to enjoy it too. Our Game-Master explained to us that he decided according to his desire to replace the introductory video with an oral briefing. We told him that we found it a shame and he replied that he had made this choice to ‚Äúsave time‚Äù.  We didn't understand why we needed to save time...? We arrived on time. We paid for a game. We should have the right to enjoy a complete experience, as the creators of the game imagined it.  When we asked the game master how it was possible to come across another team in the first room of the game when we had just finished our adventure, he told us that there had been a lack of communication between him and the game master. another game master on scheduling reservations‚Ä¶  Despite this, the room is large and family-friendly, we mainly only had problems with the game masters and their lack of professionalism and organization. I hope Prizoners will take this into account and correct this in the future.",a year ago,2024-12-27 19:45:36.158136,2.0,Jimin Lee,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115377033805272729541/reviews?hl=en

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaVpTVVVREAE,"It's not smart of them to refuse to move the date when you're really sick. They told me that I should have taken out cancellation insurance, but it didn't actually cover me, the conditions for being able to cancel are far too precise and picky. The team only responded to me once, and then no more response. I don't find it honest and commercial.  As a result, I came completely sick, I took the risk of infecting everyone, and I suddenly didn't want to set foot there again.  It's a lose/lose situation. Too bad for you.
