ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzMTRQWTVBRRAB,"It is one of the most beautiful churches in Paris, and also one of the rare churches that can be admired almost undisturbed. It is said to be one of the churches that influenced British architect Christopher Wren when designing St. Paul's Cathedral in London. To see it, you must enter the adjacent Mus√©e du service de sant√© des arm√©es (Military Medical Museum). To the right of the front fence facing Place Alphonse Laveran on Rue Saint-Jacques, there is a small locked gate that allows you to enter by ringing the doorbell. A banner reading ``Mus√©e du Service de sant√© des arm√©es'' hangs on the front fence. From there, walk through the forecourt, leave your passport at the gate, receive an admission pass in exchange, and proceed to the museum entrance. Entrance fee to the museum is 5 euros. This museum chronicles the history of medical care in the military, displaying old medical equipment and paintings and photographs of emergency medical care on the battlefield. The museum building itself is a renovated old military hospital, so you can feel the weight of history. From inside the museum, go through a passageway to access the church's basilica. As mentioned above, you have to leave your passport and pay 5 euros just to get inside, so it is a high hurdle for regular tourists to visit, so you can spend most of the time enjoying the church to yourself.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3cHZfZ2NnEAE,"The church of Our Lady of Val-de-Gr√¢ce Hospital is located in Paris, in the 5th arrondissement. It is an important example of French Baroque architecture (the so-called baroque classicism). The church was built at the behest of Queen Anna of Austria to fulfill a vow made to the Virgin Mary following her repeated difficulties in conceiving; difficulties that had meant that the royal family remained without an heir for 23 years after the marriage, which took place in 1615. Built to a design by Fran√ßois Mansart in 1645, it was completed by Jacques Lemercier in 1667. The church is dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus, as can be read on the pediment of the temple: Iesu nascenti Virginio Matri. The fa√ßade, on two orders, is preceded by a classical pronaos, while, on the sides of the fa√ßade, two volutes connect the lower register with the upper one. In its general layout it is inspired by the facades of contemporary Roman churches, in particular the facade of the church of Santa Susanna by Carlo Maderno, from which it differs, however, for a more decisive reference to classical forms. The interior, with a longitudinal plan, recalls the style of Roman churches, with the central nave and the large side chapels which end in the dome area. Here, in the pillars that support the vault, four chapels open up which look directly towards the dome, through diagonal passages; in this way the centrality of the construction is strengthened. The interior decoration is once again inspired by the Roman models of the time, such as in the main altar where the Bernini-style canopy stands out. In the church there is a pipe organ built by Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll and modified by Koenig in 1928 and by Delangue-Hurvy between 1992 and 1993. With mechanical transmission with Barker lever, it has two keyboards of 56 notes each and a pedal board of 32.",5 months ago,2025-02-09 15:19:42.142941,5.0,daniele pedroni,"1,719",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106356302369543242970/reviews?hl=en
