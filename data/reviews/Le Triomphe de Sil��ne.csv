ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQc05uY1FnEAE,"There are over 100 monuments scattered throughout the Luxembourg Gardens including this sculptural group called The Triumph of Silenis, the Greek god of Dance. It is the work of Aime Jules Dalou and was unveiled in 1885.  What you see is bronze of a jovial and drunk Silenis being propped up on his donkey by a group of characters in what feels like a chaotic comedy scene. It is an interesting statue that is worth a walk around to view from various sides, helps create a fuller picture of what is taking place.",a month ago,2024-12-27 21:16:46.992349,4.0,Brad,"5,430",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzakwzMGdRRRAB,"Le Triomphe de Silène, created by Aimé-Jules Dalou in 1885, is a bronze sculpture representing Silenus, the father of Dionysus, the god of wine and joy. Silenus is depicted drunk and staggering, sitting on top of a donkey, surrounded by a nymph and a mixture of naked bodies ready to collapse! This sculpture is a masterpiece of neo-baroque art, with meticulous attention to detail and a realistic depiction of the characters' emotions and postures. The sculpture's pyramidal composition adds a sense of balance and stability, despite the appearance of disorder and chaos.",a month ago,2024-12-27 21:16:46.994351,5.0,daniele pedroni,"1,662",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106356302369543242970/reviews?hl=en-GB
