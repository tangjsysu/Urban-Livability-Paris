ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYcHNMWWRREAE,It's a pretty big museum and the good thing is it's FREE to visit. The collection displayed is also very prominent and unique. But the museum map is a bit confusing. And also try not to miss the garden access where you can sit and relax while having a coffee. The good thing about this museum is that it's part of the Paris Museums and the permanent exhibition is completely free in this museum so you should visit here if you have enough time and want to amaze yourself. You can also witness a lot of art and history about Paris and see how medusa was influencing people in the olden times. I definitely recommend going to this museum.,a month ago,2024-12-27 21:44:15.105035,4.0,Rahul Agarwal,230,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118183620553811056026/reviews?hl=en-GB
