ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwd1lpM1B3EAE,"I was in France last week and took an early morning jog along the River Seine. I went to where Thomas Jefferson stood and where they say he found architectural inspiration for his Monticello when looking at Paris‚Äô Hotel Salm. The Hotel de Salm was constructed between 1782 and 1787. Thomas Jefferson was the US ambassador to France from 1785-1789. I believe the statue was dedicated in July 2006, according to the French written on Jefferson‚Äôs statue.  I also went to where the Treaty of Paris was signed at 56 Rue de Jacob, signed in 1783. John Adams (our future 2nd president) was one of the signers of that document. That was the treaty that officially ended the American Revolution. I‚Äôll post pictures of that later.  It was amazing to see so many 18th century buildings still standing in France! Obviously, their history goes beyond US History. We‚Äôre babies, if you put our historical timelines up against each other. üë∂ üòÉ  I‚Äôd like to think that Jefferson‚Äôs Declaration of Independence and our American Revolution inspired the French Revolution of 1789, which led to the beheading of their monarch, King Louis XVI and changing the world.
