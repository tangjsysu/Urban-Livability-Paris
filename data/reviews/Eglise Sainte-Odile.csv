Altarpiece unique in the world for its size, a magnificently decorated altar and 3 huge glass roofs - not stained glass windows - absolutely superb. Considering the configuration of the land granted, the architect did a remarkable job. Very nice discovery but to fully enjoy the visit, I recommend a guided tour (on the Art Culture et Foi website) and especially to wait for the reopening of the Ste-Odile square currently closed for work, which allows you to see the exterior from the right side as well as the 3 domes on the roof. Finally, the church has no setback, and the right side is blind because it adjoins a building. However, avenue St√©phane Mallarm√© is undergoing major work until spring 2023 to install the tramway.
