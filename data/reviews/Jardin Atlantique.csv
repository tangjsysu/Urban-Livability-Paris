ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyOC15ZFBREAE,I discovered this garden by mistake while entering the Gare Montparnasse. Its a sort of concrete garden with greenery between buildings and on the roof of the train station . The kids section is fine with a big sandy area . It needs more maintenance it looked outdated though . Not easy to stroll with a pousette . Thete is some ping pong tables and basket ball courts .,2 years ago,2025-01-24 13:46:47.112417,4.0,Melted Butter,753,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107103583576047550752/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyckp1S1hnEAE,Discovered this beautiful garden during a Photography walk. Very concrete and beautiful garden on top of Train Station Montparnasse with little sound of the trains passing under the way. If we are waiting for a train then we can definitly visit here and sit down in the sun during summers.,2 years ago,2025-01-24 13:46:47.114418,4.0,Sumit Sharma,72,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104992436908931092444/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzMjZMQ2ZBEAE,"The children’s area is not well cared for at all. I’m shocked this park is so highly recommended! We walked twenty minutes to get there and found it smelly (lots of private corners to pee in apparently) and the pirate ship that is supposed to be the main attraction is completely run down and the slide has plywood screwed on, preventing any use.  My husband noted the entire place looked like it should be the scene of an apocalypse movie. Head to the kids playground at Luxembourg Gardens - about 20 minutes walk from Jardin Atlantique but dramatically better.",4 years ago,2025-01-24 13:46:47.115418,1.0,Katherine Zanaty,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116127752354277605505/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZbUtIMEtREAE,"We climbed a narrow steel staircase above the  busy and noisy Gare Montparnasse and like magic we were transported in this serene park with wavy patterns on its pavements, deck, rails and even  terraced gardens simulating the shores of the Atlantique. Except for the hissing sound of the metro tracks, it is easy to forget the dizzying activities beneath it. You hear the chirping of birds, the bouncing of a tennis ball, the gay singing of a toddler brought out for a morning walk. Even the breeze announces its presence.
