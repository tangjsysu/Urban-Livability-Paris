ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURucDlEMGlRRRAB,This Joan of Arc statue is located bronze statue Blvd Saint-Marcel south of Jardin des Plantes. This is the work of French sculptor √âmile-Fran√ßois Chatrousse and was erected here in 1891.  What is interesting about this monument to Joan of Arc is that is not the usual depiction of the French Heroine as a warrior on horseback. Instead you see her standing and looking forward. She holds flag in right hand and her shield in the other while sword is held in scabbard.,3 months ago,2025-01-24 11:44:06.084806,3.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB

We know his tragic end, accused and betrayed by Bishop Cauchon!
