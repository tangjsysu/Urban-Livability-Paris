ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIeDkzNjhBRRAB,"Magnificent flower garden in a beautiful architectural setting. This garden perfectly illustrates the art of so-called French gardens. Trimmed box hedges create flowerbeds with geometric shapes. Throughout the seasons, plants and flowers flourish there, magnifying the facade of the H√¥tel de Sens. A rare testimony to medieval civil architecture in Paris, the hotel was built from 1475 to 1519, on the order of Tristan de Salazar, archbishop of Sens. He hosted for a few months Marguerite de Valois (1553-1615), ‚ÄúQueen Margot‚Äù, first wife of King Henri IV (1553-1610). The cardinal archbishops left him in 1622. Sold as national property during the Revolution, it was successively a laundry, a canning factory and the depot of a glassworks, among others. The City of Paris bought it in 1911 and restored it from 1929 to 1961.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleXNldm1nRRAB,"Rush into this garden! To escape the noise of the city, immerse yourself in the novel that keeps you going, or take a walk with a loved one.  On a small surface area, this space offers you a perfect example of an extraordinarily colorful French garden.  If the geometry, the flowerbeds, and the little carefully trimmed box hedges horrify you, go ahead anyway!  Because at the end of summer, the underlying geometry disappears under vaporous clouds of flowers in bright colors.  It‚Äôs a parade that you‚Äôre attending. Dahlias, Japanese anemones and marsh sages set themselves a challenge. It‚Äôs the one that will point closest to the clouds.  The local gardeners took part in this insane race towards the blue by setting up bamboo tripods, which the ipomeas decided to climb at full speed.  Let yourself be exhilarated by this crazy ride which will transport you elsewhere... perhaps to the time of medieval Paris, if you continue the walk by discovering the H√¥tel de Sens which overlooks the garden, and which once housed the famous Queen Margot.
