The time of construction of the Saint-Jacques-du-Haute-Pa church dates back to the first half of the 17th century.  Until 1630, it belonged to the 12th century.  Order of St.  John of the earth was a small chapel.  In 1572, Benedictine monks from Saint-Magloire Abbey also settled next to it. In 1675 architect D. Gittard developed a new project for the reconstruction of this temple.  The main works were completed after 10 years, and in May 1685 the church was re-consecrated.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBcVlTNFNREAE,"This church, a historic building, has a long and controversial history. In 1180 the Brothers of Altospacio, Italy, settled (that's where the name Du Haut Pas comes from). There were only fields and low houses. In 1459 Pope Pius II dissolved the order, but some decided to stay. In 1572 Catherine de' Medici installed some expelled Benedictines. A church is built, but it quickly becomes too small. In 1630, work on the current church began, which continued for a long time.
