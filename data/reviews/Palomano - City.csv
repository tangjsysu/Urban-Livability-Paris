ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyejhuSmVREAE,"Great place for kids to play but super crowded, speaking with the owner (I think) he said itâ€™s best to come around opening. We chose the last available slot so it got emptier every 20 minutes or so.  High quality toys and activities, easy to see thatâ€™s lots of effort has been put into all of this. Negative point though when it comes to the price, 2 kids and 2 adults ran us 42â‚¬.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkM0xUTmpRRRAB,"A very nice imitation play area. Children have a lot of fun doing things like adults: in the supermarket, at the hairdresser, on the plane or the fire truck, etc. Booking time of 2 hours well suited for children to enjoy all the activities, the number of children in the room is completely compatible so that everyone plays in turn. A tip: remember to take a pair of socks suitable for comfortable movement in the space because it is obligatory to take off our shoes. However, a few points could be improved: - to make the supermarket more attractive, install cash registers with a barcode reader, children love it - at times, certain spaces are in great disorder, everything is mixed up and the animators responsible for redoing the set-up are not very quick to intervene - at the entrance, the installation of benches would greatly help pregnant women or people with reduced mobility to put their shoes back on.",a month ago,2024-12-27 19:28:04.473067,4.0,Catherine Cailleux,253,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111676973618783806408/reviews?hl=en

At first glance, the setting with adult eyes is sad because in the photos we think we see distinct spaces, but we find ourselves in a large room with the worlds in a single room. A second space exists, but I found it by chance thinking of going to the toilet.  With children's eyes, however, we see that it works, they are in paradise.  For the supermarket, only 2 shopping carts available, very very difficult to get one (wait behind a child who has one while waiting for him to finish)  No possibility of having a real snack on site for them (just cakes and fruit juices for sale).

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsd09IOTl3RRAB,"We imagined the place much bigger so a little disappointed. A nice experience but it lacks space to be able to relax a little as parents. With a 3/5 year old child I think it's good. Beyond that they are too big in my opinion unless they are really not used to going out to parks with activities. Positive points: small one-off surprise events with animators (an event at the firefighter corner with ""physical training"" and a 2nd with a disguised parade for Halloween during our 2 short hours of presence). Quite a bit of equipment in each area overall so the children will all be able to put on firefighter equipment then airplane pilot then cook equipment, etc. And every corner is realistic. Really quite a lot of people when we were there in the middle of the day in our 2-hour slot reserved in advance (perhaps come outside school holidays to make it more fluid) Palomano has a large main room, a space for the little ones and finally a nook attached to the main room with the hairdressing, medicine and cleaning corner. Everyone takes off their shoes at the entrance and we leave our belongings in a locker.

There are a lot of accessories, it's quite realistic and I think a lot of children can relate to it. The motor skills area/quiet time is welcome for the little ones. Motor skills modules, river stones, books, blackboard etc... There is what you need to change babies in the adult toilets. We were also able to park easily in the adjacent streets, which is appreciated. For the downsides: the scanner in the grocery area did not work, therefore disappointing for children, very few shopping carts available. Some adults do not take their responsibilities and stay chatting on the furniture of the restaurant which is initially used for children to play, leaving their children unsupervised and therefore free-wheeling in the play areas. It would be nice if someone could call parents to order for the good of all. Furthermore, the fact of having to go to the toilet in socks personally really poses a hygiene problem for me, we used charlottes to put on the feet, but given the floor it would be good if there were overshoes available because the ground is wet with unidentified liquids.
