ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNueVlqVGh3RRAB,"I had the privilege of attending an event at this magnificent museum last night.  What it lacks in size it makes up for in Spirit, literally and figuratively.  The art and objects on display are a celebration of beauty and knowledge as much as they are part of the fabric of Irfan and the deeper spiritual traditions found in every culture.  The exhibits invite deep contemplation and a savoring of the incredible power of Human Creativity.",5 months ago,2025-03-15 22:14:19.147338,5.0,Nomad Foodie,34,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112129201726671857342/reviews?hl=en-US

In a 19th century house with a view of the Seine, very well renovated and surrounded by a garden, also restored. Is not about the history of Sufism but about Sufi arts and culture. A stunning hologram is also visible on the Sufism. Temporary exhibition of contemporary art in addition to the presentation of the permanent collection. In January 2025, I also participated in the volunteer program on the maintenance and development of the garden. Remarkable and very well organized idea: these volunteers (who participate for a few hours per month, with a flexible commitment) are supervised by a professional landscape gardener, very educational, knowledgeable about the plants planted, teaching you the right gesture, but also the history of these plants. you register as a volunteer at reception or by answering a questionnaire following a visit to the museum.",a month ago,2025-03-15 22:14:19.155441,5.0,Henri Docquin,67,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101048533351716685667/reviews?hl=en
