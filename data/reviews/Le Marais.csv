ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOeXNYWk53EAE,"Probably the only area in whole of Paris where I did not feel safe. Also was tricked by the tourist trap restaurant into eating there. Food was bland and restaurant like a tourist trap factory. Internet and mobile was blocked there and google does not let me post my review which seems to be a common occurrence at that place. After we left we were followed by a very shady person until we lost him in metro. Took a picture and reported him to authorities. The restaurant without the queue and ""bodyguards"" is way better. Don't be fooled by the ""reviews"". I feel like most of them are generated by bots and the negative ones not posted or deleted. Nice backeries in the area and a good sock shop also. Unfortunately closed when we visited.",11 months ago,2024-12-27 21:04:47.858722,1.0,Lo,145,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113282196200729733060/reviews?hl=en-GB
