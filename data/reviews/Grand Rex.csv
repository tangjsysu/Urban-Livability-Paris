ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiX1ktZHRRRRAB,"I went here in June of 2024 for the Sonic Symphony, being one of the few locations in Europe. It's an incredibly beautiful venue and the Concert Hall was also very decorated and grand. It is connected directly to the metro which makes it very convenient for coming from other places of Paris. Audio controls worked very well and it wasn't overbearingly loud for what it was (the 2nd half of the concert is very rock-based). Seats were mostly comfortable although I was mostly standing up for the duration of the concert. For events and concerts of this scale, the place works really well and I ended up liking it.

Some accommodation are made for disabled people but only the one who show to be wheelchair bound, other wise they'll just expect you to accommodate to their lack of accommodation. The bad quality of seating and space for legs is incredibly ridiculous for the price we pay. The staff there is not even trained to welcome us properly,  they did the bare minimum : letting us in front of abled people when we showed our cards, but they still made us wait in the cold outside 10-15min after the announced opening time, with no way to sit. They did not even pointed the stairless path, eventhough I specificity asked for it. And to get out it's walk or die, as there is no way to go down through mechanic stairways, so additional to the stairs I had to walk up after mechanical stairway, I had to go all the way down, swallowing my pain. It's pathetic for such a big venue to not know and do their best to welcome everyone in 2024, and giving the excuse of ""old building"" I've been to many old building and they managed to make it accessible, maybe it's time to rethink your accessibility, because it is not a reason in 2024, you have solutions, not implementing them is laziness and lack of respect for disabled people (took away the second star for the place using excuses that were ok in the 90s)",2 months ago,2025-01-24 14:17:19.694869,1.0,Coralie Tardy,23,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113533664086268240867/reviews?hl=en
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKbE9lUWdBRRAB,"One of the coolest movie experiences I‚Äôve ever had.  We ended watching a movie here truly by chance as I won 2-1 movie tickets from McDonalds and was a selection of random theatres I‚Äôve never heard of and this was the only place playing a English version of the movie we wanted to see.  Honestly if o could watch all my movies here I would. The old decor is like stepping back in time. The staff are really friendly and snacks are reasonably priced. The movie seats were up stairs on the balcony overlooking the stage and they played the previews on the screen on the stage but when the movie started the biggest projector screen rolled down from the ceiling and it was amazing !!!!!!!!!!!  History:  In the early 1930s, Jacques Ha√Øk, a wealthy movie producer and distributor and the owner of the Olympia, got the idea of building a very extravagant cinema: it could have a capacity of more than 5000 spectators on a surface area of 2,000 m¬≤, with a ceiling peaking at more than 30 meters, representing a luminous starry vault.  Its designers are the architect Auguste Bluysen and the engineer John Eberson. The fa√ßade is designed by the sculptor Henri-√âdouard Navarre and the decoration of the great hall by Maurice Dufr√™ne.  The Grand Rex is a scale model of the famous Radio City Music Hall in New York City.  The Grand Rex hall opens its doors on the evening of December 8, 1932, in the presence of the cinema's pioneer, Louis Lumi√®re and 3,300 guests. The Three Musketeers by Henri Diamant-Berger is on the bill.  It is renowned for hosting premieres with the films‚Äô crews as well as special events, called ‚ÄúMarathons‚Äù, which gathers the fans of a franchise (Star Wars, Marvel Cinematic Universe, the adaptations of Tolkien‚Äôs work or else The Hunger Games for example).",a year ago,2025-01-24 14:17:19.695867,5.0,1girl 1passport,464,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114173150363066963223/reviews?hl=en

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwblltaXl3RRAB,"Let's start with the negatives. The seats are not comfortable, if you have longer legs, you will have problems (I'm 185 cm tall and my knees were touching the seat in front of me). Also, since the building is under construction, the number of bathrooms is limited.  Now the good things and some tips. The cinema is beautiful old building and it's worth to visit. I was sceptical about the screen size, but don't worry, in the large screening room there is another screen in the ceiling, they will put it down shortly before the movie starts. That also means since there are no seat numbers and you and everyone else picks their seat on their own as they come to the room, you don't have to ""fight"" for the seats at the edge of the balcony (as we did), but you can find yourself a seat located higher, where it suits you and your long legs - don't worry, the screen is really huge, you will be able to see everything. The sound is also great. The room has some ambient lights on, they will turn them off as well, but I advice you, during the movie just look up to the ceiling, it's quite nice.  We tried some snacks bought in the lobby and if you like to buy something before the movie, it won't disappoint you. The small popcorn is really small, but I'm not a snack-during-a-movie guy.

The service was friendly and efficient, and the comfort of the seats made for an enjoyable viewing experience. The quality of the sound and visuals was top-notch, making it easy to get lost in the film.  What sets the Grand Rex apart is its unique atmosphere and history. The largest cinema in Europe, it has been entertaining movie-goers since 1932 and has hosted countless premieres and events.  While I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at the Grand Rex, I deducted one star for the lack of options in the concession stand. It would be great to see a wider variety of snacks and drinks available to enhance the overall experience.  In terms of improvement, I suggest exploring more diverse film offerings and programming.
