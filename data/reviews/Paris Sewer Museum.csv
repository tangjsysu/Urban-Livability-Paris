So many things you can explore inside with lots of miniatures and explanations. The entry is free for you and your companion if you have a disability, we didn’t expect that.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4eHRhRVZnEAE,This was a unique and interesting experience to be able to visit a working sewer and see what goes on under our feet. There are small information plaques along the way that give you little bits of information and then lots of information at the end of the visit (they could space this out more for less crowding). There are rats down there if you’re squeamish. I enjoyed the section on the environment and it’s connection to the sewers and what we put in them.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5bjZma2tRRRAB,"The Musée des Egouts offers an immersive (not literally!) experience of Paris' urban surface water and sewage infrastructure.  As a visitor one gains access to a number of live sewer tunnels. The sewage odour is moderate but not overwhelming. No protective equipment is required to be worn but visitors are advised of basic sanitary measures such as not touching surfaces & to wash hands after visiting the museum. A range of displays provide an understanding of the past present and future of Paris' sewer system.  A tip for non French speakers: All signage and interpretation is in French only, so we recommend paying for an audio guide for an additional €3. Audio guides are available in English and Spanish.  ps. the toilets at The Musée des Egouts were  probably the best public toilets we experienced in Paris!",9 months ago,2024-12-28 16:11:09.167972,5.0,Hugh Chapman,19,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101428365430103270299/reviews?hl=en-GB

If you’re an English speaker, they give you a link to open up a website that has an English guide but this doesn’t align with the placards. Yes there is a smell, it’s a functioning sewer after all.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQLXNQX0tREAE,This museum is not ment for English speakers. We entered the museum and were greeted in French. We said we only understand almost no French. It was obvious that we were tourist but they didn’t say anything about it. Once we went into the museum we realised everything was in French. So we went back to the desk and suddenly we get an English binder which had seen better days and was falling apart. After that we entered the museum again to find out it is quite hard to combine the text with the correct text in the binder. At the entrance they also claimed to have an audio guide which would’ve been nice but this services was out of use. After all this our experience was very mediocre and was not worth our money. I don’t recommend this museum for English speaking people until they fix the audio guides or do something about the bad quality of the binders+route.

Sure enough, I got down to the displays and after walking around I found the active sewer part of the museum and it did have a smell haha But it was just so surreal to be waking among the equipment that is hidden beneath the city surface.

You will see instruments and engineering that you hardly see nowhere else. However, I cannot give it more than 2 stars. The reason is that all explanations and panels are only in French. Hence, if you are not a french speaker (and I mentioned it at the entrance), you will find the museum not informative at all, which is a pity.
