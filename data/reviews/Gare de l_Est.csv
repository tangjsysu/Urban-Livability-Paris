ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1dU5tdEtBEAE,"Going back to Germany..... In Europe there are many efficient transportation options for traveling long destinations one country to another. You can opt ultra modern buses, cheap flights or high speed trains. The buses are cheaper in compare to train and flight. Flix Bus, Mega Bus, Eurolines Bus etc are very popular in Europe. I personally find bus services are more convenient, affordable and easy to use. Their comfortable seats, onboard entertainment, free Wi-Fi and power outlets gave me a safe and pleasant travel experience. As a compact continent with many countries located in close proximity to each other, Europe is highly connected by an abundance of relatively cheap flights between a variety of destinations. Hence flights are cheaper then train on some routes but the Airlines allow only 10 kg luggage, beyond that is to be paid. Journeying by discount airline continues to be a viable transportation option, especially since domestic flight connections usually involve a shorter transit time than choosing to travel via bus or train. Airlines like Ryan, KLM, Esay Jet, Transavia etc are good options among many. Europe has an excellent rail infrastructure and made train travel one of the most popular transportation modes throughout the continent. Train travel in Europe is very convenient not only for quick jaunts to nearby cities but also for longer-distance international journeys. Most major cities in Europe are connected by high-speed train routes. The high speed trains are bit expensive but exciting and amazing. Please note that prices of train tickets also fluctuate considerably, so one has to book tickets well in advance as possible. The major train operators in Europe are Eurostar, NTV, Renfe, SNCF, Thalys, and Trenitalia to name a few. I have taken SNCF high speed train for Paris to Germany today. SNCF (French National Railway Company)founded in the year 1948 is France's national state-owned railway company. It operates the country's national rail traffic along with Monaco, including the TGV, France's high-speed rail network. In France it's called the Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF). I had traveled by Bus and budget flight too in Europe. It is surprising to know that, there are some bus/train routes that beat flight. Taking bus or high speed train are sometimes quicker options than flying.
