ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzX04zYk13EAE,"The Effort sculpture is situated in the northwest corner of the Luxembourg Gardens. It is the work of Pierre Roche (1896). What you see is a male figure supposedly representing one of the twelve labours of Hercules. Originally intended to be part of a large fountain, The Effort instead found its way into the Gardens nuzzled up against trees and shrubs where you find it today. Worth a look-see if passing by and interested in sculptures.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 11:12:53.161342,3.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en
