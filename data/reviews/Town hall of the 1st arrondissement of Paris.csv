Then, she responded suddenly angrily saying she's doing the paperwork if I talk to her, it's disturbing her!! She is there to do paperwork, but for her, we, the civilians, do not have the right to ask her any questions, because she is not interested, she prefers to answer daily tasks to her colleagues.

First remark how you used to travel in Europe (another pearl), well ladies in Europe we do not travel with a passport, but an identity card, so no emergency passport needed!  A town hall receptionist cannot rule on an emergency status, adds to him, that his future audair employer should have put a professional stamp in addition to his manual signature?!  In Canada (country of my husband's future employer), it is not obligatory for a company (which is not legal like a law firm) to have a stamp in its name, the employer had her site, and what to be called obviously she refused! Ah but it's true, from her position at reception, she surely goes to Canada very often!
