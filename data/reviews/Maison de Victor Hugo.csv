The museum is an old house which does a great job at showing his life story, as well as the furnishings of the period.  There are only 4 rooms decorated in the style of the era but each room has a lot to see - paintings, other artwork, documents and decor. I didn’t know that Hugo was a poet, painter and draftsman in addition to author. In his middle age, there was a lot of political activity in France and Hugo was exiled for almost 20 years to the British isle of Guernsey. I had no idea about any of that so it was an educational visit as well as interesting.  Their cafe was good - they offer a few hot dishes each day, plus sandwiches, salads and desserts.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSb01Ib0NREAE,"A Charming Journey through Victor Hugo's Life  4/5 Stars: I had a lovely time exploring Maison de Victor Hugo in Paris, a beautiful tribute to the famous writer's life and work. From the moment I stepped inside, I was struck by the cozy and intimate ambiance of the place, which perfectly matched the spirit of Hugo's romanticism.  The staff was welcoming and knowledgeable, providing me with useful information about the exhibitions and the house itself. I appreciated the effort put into the displays, which were creative and informative, featuring various original manuscripts, letters, and paintings. The house itself was a delight to behold, with its elegant architecture and period furniture, giving me a sense of stepping back in time.  However, I must admit that there were some downsides to the experience. One complaint I had was the limited amount of space for visitors, which made it difficult to move around during peak hours. Additionally, some of the displays were not well-lit, making it hard to read the texts or fully appreciate the artworks.  Despite these minor issues, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Maison de Victor Hugo and would recommend it to anyone interested in French literature or history. The place offers a unique perspective on the life and times of one of France's most celebrated writers, and its charm is sure to win over even the most skeptical visitor.  If I could offer any suggestions for improvement, it would be to provide more seating areas for visitors and to improve the lighting in certain areas of the exhibition. Overall, I am grateful for the opportunity to have visited Maison de Victor Hugo and would love to return in the future.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an immersive and engaging experience in the heart of Paris.
