It has very sharp hinge inside which damaged my bam case so badly, even though the length of a violin case actually fits in the locker perfectly, the hinge is huge and intruding and sharp that would ""bite"" into your case the moment you try to close the door. And to the lady who's working there: if you feel any resistance when closing the door, please double check and don't push it. I barely had any mood to see the exhibitions upstairs. The more I see other delicate instruments, the more grief I feel about my own. The staff in the museum all did great job, it's just that I don't have a mood to appreciate the music anymore because my violin is like my life, c'est ma vie, and now even the best case I can get to protect it got damaged, ironically, at the museum of music.

It was designed with the nearby Conservatoire de Paris (CNSMDP) by the architect Christian de Portzamparc and opened in 1995. Part of Fran√ßois Mitterrand's Grands Projets, the Cit√© de la Musique reinvented La Villette ‚Äì the former slaughterhouse district.  It consists of an amphitheater, a concert hall that can accommodate an audience of 800‚Äì1,000, a music museum containing an important collection of music instruments from different cultural traditions, dating mainly from the fifteenth- to twentieth-century, a music library, exhibition halls and workshops. The Cit√© de la Musique, as an EPIC, was also entrusted by the State with the management of the Salle Pleyel, which reopened on September 13, 2006, after major renovations.
