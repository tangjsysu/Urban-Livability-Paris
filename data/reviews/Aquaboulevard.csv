ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURybXNxU2d3RRAB,"I recently visited Aquaboulevard, it proved to be extremely unsafe and poorly managed. The security checks were inconsistent, only scrutinizing some guests for ""appropriate"" swimwear. In my opinion, the required swimwear was impractical and uncomfortable‚Äîtoo skimpy for males and too tight for females who prefer loose-fitting clothing. The staff made a fuss about my partner's swimwear while ignoring mine, even though I was wearing what they said was not allowed.  The park had only three lifeguards, all stationed at the main swimming areas, leaving the slides completely unmonitored. This lack of supervision led to dangerous situations, with guests ignoring safety rules. We witnessed three people nearly injuring themselves on the straight shot water slide. No one was there to instruct on proper posture or head protection, and my partner and I almost got injured ourselves.  The chaos extended beyond the slides. Guests disregarded safety guidelines, leading to a generally hazardous environment. The only slightly redeeming feature was the presence of Jacuzzis and hot tubs throughout the park, but these were also unsupervised. Children were dunking their heads and splashing, making it impossible for adults to relax.  Maintenance was abysmal. We encountered broken or loose structures, such as a dangerously wobbly ladder exiting the main Jacuzzi and a loose metal floor mat near one of the slides that nearly caused us to slip.  The changing rooms were soaking wet and neglected, creating a serious slip hazard. The lockers were filthy and inconvenient, requiring guests to carry the key all day. Worst of all, the changing areas were completely unsupervised, allowing inappropriate behavior to occur in plain sight.(Yes I am talking about what you think I am, we heard it, LOUD AND CLEAR)  Overall, I would not recommend this water park to anyone. The only possible appeal might be for parents indifferent to their children's safety, as the lack of rules creates an environment where kids can run wild and risk injury. Save your time and money and find a safer, better-maintained park for your day out.",5 months ago,2024-12-27 19:38:41.284060,1.0,Propumpkin,95,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104907243509694739986/reviews?hl=en-GB

Stressful,  I immediately contacted the security guys and they explained to me that someone had noticed that my locker was opened and called them, so they had to keep my stuffs with them for security reasons since my locker was completely opened.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3LUxDMXdRRRAB,"A mixed experience: First of, AquaBoulevard is great because it is close to central Paris, easy to get to. The waterpark is huge with many great possibilities, fitting everyone. A great wellness area, some fun slides, a cozy mini golf course etc. Why only 3 stars then? AquaBoulevard could definitely improve their cleaning, as some of the areas wasn‚Äôt clean enough. Especially the changing rooms were gross. They should Put a limit on the amount of people allowed in, as there were way to many people in the park - it was crazy! People did not respect the queues, and the queues were extremely long, which made the waiting time for the waterslides not worth it going. We bought an extra access for an exclusive area of the park, but that was no difference, still way to many people there as well. My recommendation: limit the amount of people allowed to Enter - and make a small pool area only for adults (the wellness was +16 i Think, but still - it was to busy, even at 9pm). And most of the staff was really Nice and service minded, especially the lifeguard with the blonde afro-hair. But there was this one lifeguard with blond/brown curly hair, working at the swing-rope, who was the most arrogant guy, who shouldn‚Äôt be working with customer service. He shut the door in our face as we were about to enter from the outside area, still during opening times (around 8pm), and he refused to let us in, so we had to take a long walk to get inside. Asking him Why he did that, he ignored me. If you ask me: a straight up idiot. I hope his supervisors sees this. (Both of these guys were working Sunday 12th of august until closing time)  And last thing: the slides closes around 8pm, so even though the park is open to 11pm, be aware of this. We chose to wait for the kids to go Home before using the slides, but then they closed‚Ä¶ yeah I‚Äôm an adult, but a child on the inside, ahah;)  All in all a great experience, but I would definitely recommend going there during weekdays, and avoid the weekend.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBcWZ5aHRBRRAB,"Large water park with many different slides and things to do. Make sure to bring your own towels and ‚Ç¨2 coins for the lockers. Men cannot wear loose swimming trunks, but luckily the Decathlon store nearby sells tight boxer-type shorts, we got ours for only ‚Ç¨3.  The slides vary in difficulty from easy to medium to hard, you have to be quite assertive when climbing the stairs to where the slides are because of people trying to push past, and there is no clear separation for the lines for different slides so it tends to become crowded at the top, leading to longer waiting times.  There are also much fewer staff members supervising than what you might see elsewhere, so some people take advantage of this and are disruptive, push past, or go down slides without waiting for the light to turn green.  The outdoor and indoor pools also have a wave machine turned on every now and then.",6 years ago,2024-12-27 19:38:50.465344,4.0,Dominic Lounes,13,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100597033195686170913/reviews?hl=en
