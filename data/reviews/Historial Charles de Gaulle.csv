ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdWJ5YXp3RRAB,A very nice homage to the leader of the French Resistance during WW2. The museum wing contains also personal items donated by Charles De Gaulle himself.  It is heavily focused on the period during World War 2 and pays tribute to every soldier during the resistance.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1ejlIbFl3EAE,"Overall the course is very interesting, complete and immersive on Charles de Gaulle. You can also find information about his childhood and his presidency under the Fifth Republic. In the center you can find a short documentary of around twenty minutes retracing the life of the General.  What I find unfortunate, however, is the ""politicization"" of the museum, which seems more to be a eulogy to the General than an informative museum, and I am thinking in particular of the film (which, moreover, is produced by the Fondation de Gaulle) which seems to me to be a good political move. It may be an impression but I find it a shame.  The welcome at the historic is pleasant. The audio guides are nevertheless quite average, and sometimes buggy.  Despite this last point, I recommend the historial, but come to the idea that this may have a political twist.",2 years ago,2024-12-28 15:57:52.858132,4.0,Yvan Chambon,9,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116459552140094188519/reviews?hl=en

The scenography is very good, the provision of the free headset (although difficult to hold) is a good addition and allows you to enjoy all the videos and documents in the museum.
