ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNDlXOC1RRRAB,Beautiful beautiful church. I love a church decorated with more color. Worth a visit but it is newer and perhaps has less historical significance.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlX2NfUTV3RRAB,"Beautiful church which we only stumbled across because it shares a name with our parish in Falkirk, Scotland and we were lucky enough to visit during adoration  It turns out to be a shrine of St Madeleine Sophie Barat, whose remains are here (they were in Belgium until 2009, but moved back to her home).  She was the founder of the Society of the Sacred Heart, so very appropriate we stopped here after visiting Sacré Coeur.  In addition there are beautiful pictures depicting the missionary work and life of St Francis Xavier and also a chapel dedicated to the Infant Child of Prague.  We'll worth a visit, especially as it's just across the road from the metro and close to other attractions such as The Miraculous Medal Shrine and Chapel of St Vincent de Paul.",2 years ago,2025-02-09 15:21:55.443749,5.0,Idris Evans,188,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106668611622806791394/reviews?hl=en-US

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3bktyanBRRRAB,"This church looks remarkable from the outside. It's one of the largest churches in Paris. It's very near Jardin du Luxembourg. It's open quite late and it's free to get in.  Plus, it's not very busy. It's mostly visited by locals who have come to pray, and some Da Vinci Code tourists. However, I didn't even know of the connection until I read a few reviews mentioning that and googled some info about it.  The Da Vinci Code states that the Paris Meridian or the Rose Line as the book calls it, runs through Saint-Sulpice church. You can a see a line by the Obelisk; however this line is used to determine the winter solstice and Easter.  Although, the architecture is quite impressive, the inside is in desperate need of some refurbishment. The first chapel, going counter clockwise, contains frescoes by Delacroix. They include ""The Battle of Jacob with the Angel,"" ""Saint Michael Slaying the Dragon,"" and ""The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple."" Unfortunately, this chapel was under construction and the entire view was blocked during our visit.  There is also a statue of Joan of Arc, and that chapel as well was blocked by a nativity scene. And unfortunately, almost all of the other chapels, the paintings were so damaged and dark, you could not see them at all. Plus, a lot of the stained glass windows were broken or also very dark as well. This church needs to be restored to its original glory. It's seen much better days which is a shame.  If you have a self-guided tour of the church, it can be quite fascinating. I had Rick Steves' Paris book which pointed out unique aspects of the church and told some of the history. Don't miss one of the world's largest organs located here.  Unless you're a massive fan of historical churches (or the Da Vinci Code), I wouldn't recommended going out of your way on your first visit to Paris (with limited time) to see this church. This is worth your time if it's a repeat visit to Paris, or if you're already in the area. It'll take 20 minutes to view. If it's restored, I'd imagine it would be much more worthy of your time to view!",8 years ago,2025-02-09 15:21:55.447750,3.0,Dolores Gold,182,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103939337494011798368/reviews?hl=en
