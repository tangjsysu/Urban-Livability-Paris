ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvaHMyQTNBRRAB,"This museum really deserves a visit. It was open in 2010, and it is really nice to make a visit on a sunny day, because of the light that goes through the windows. So many works you can see inside, and the ticket is not expensive 7 €. The first floor is really impressive.",6 years ago,2025-03-15 22:55:06.466491,5.0,Zoran Lutovac,119,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103038301207814559607/reviews?hl=en-US

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmZ2UyUGZREAE,"This museum does not have the notoriety of Parisian museums, and that's a shame! We discover the life and work of the sculptor Paul Belmondo, father of Jean-Paul. Several exhibition levels, with busts, bronzes, drawings, photos of the artist or his entourage. These are figurative, accessible works, and I find that the style conveys a certain softness, especially with regard to the busts of children or women.",2 months ago,2025-03-15 22:55:06.470619,5.0,Christine Pierron,60,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103830129602775803412/reviews?hl=en-US

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfcXFtcWl3RRAB,"As a real estate advisor in Boulogne Billancourt, I like to visit cult places near me and share my opinion on what I appreciated. The Paul Belmondo Museum is a true architectural gem nestled in the heart of Boulogne-Billancourt. The building, with its clean lines and its harmony between tradition and modernity, offers an ideal setting for appreciating the sculptor's works. High ceilings and large floor-to-ceiling windows allow natural light to flood the spaces, creating a calming atmosphere. A must-visit for art and architecture lovers.",2 months ago,2025-03-15 22:55:06.471620,5.0,Tiziana POMODORO,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109806137974063639480/reviews?hl=en-US
