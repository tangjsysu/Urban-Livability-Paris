ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4OHRyWjR3RRAB,"A little corner of paradise full of history  ""Peaches, history of a fruit, history of tastes, history of a place  The former agricultural site of Murs √† P√™ches allowed the development of peach arboriculture. If the etymology suggests that the peach tree originated in Persia, it actually arrived from China via the Silk Road, then from Persia to Greece in the 4th century BC. The Romans began cultivating it in the 1st century BCE and called it malum persicum; Persian apple. Archeology has revealed peach pits in Gallo-Roman remains in Saintes, in Charente. Although it has been cultivated since the Middle Ages in France, it is the development of the espalier technique which will allow the expansion of its cultivation by protecting the trees and especially its fragile flowers from the cold.  Peach trees were planted along peasant walls built of flint, earth and plaster to store the heat of the sun. The plaster coating made it possible to fix the rags, pieces of used fabric, with nails forged on site, which held the branches pressed to the walls. The peach trees grew along these wall greenhouses protected by wall copings where fabrics or straw cloths could be attached to protect the flowers from late frosts. Without this technique, fishing would never have developed in √éle-de-France.""",a year ago,2025-03-15 23:04:28.843022,5.0,Julien L√©gal,286,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108895459396717612456/reviews?hl=en
