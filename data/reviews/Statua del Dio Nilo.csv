ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmbnV5VjdBRRAB,"Impressive, tucked away gallery in Le Marais. Beyond hosting stunning collections,  the owner/founder is incredibly kind, but lives and breathes through the works displayed on the walls. Not a huge space, but the size and exhibitions lend themselves to intimacy and a default closeness to the works. Visited Jan '25, nothing but positive to share. Will stop by every time in Paris.",2 weeks ago,2025-01-24 12:52:18.761557,5.0,Steven Kenworthy,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110033859470228642411/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKekpmeW9nRRAB,"such an amazing gem of a gallery. super kind associates who even showed me some of the work that wasn't up, and offered tea! the works were beautiful. they keep their nose to the ground for up and coming artists especially from the continent, which I appreciate. I would definitely come back here, and this would be a staple gallery to me in Paris. they also have great openings it seems. sad I wouldn't be in town for it, but as a subscriber to their emails, they are great about keeping you up to date and rlly creating backing and support for the artists and shows they are participating in. go!",a year ago,2025-01-24 12:52:18.762559,5.0,kim e. powell,157,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101732093992067695279/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLdm9LUHBRRRAB,"Under the snowy and windy sky of Paris, you will find this little corner of paradise. A warmly bright space that opens its arms wide to a unique artistic discovery. There we discover contemporary African art that is still too little known in our Parisian galleries. Congratulations to this young and extremely welcoming team for introducing us to these works!! A magnificent discovery!!  Special mention to the young woman who worked there the day I went there: absolutely radiant with passion for her gallery. Thanks again to her and the whole team!",3 years ago,2025-01-24 12:52:18.765558,5.0,Nicolas Fiscus,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110661733101589214217/reviews?hl=en-GB
