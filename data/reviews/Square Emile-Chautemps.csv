ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMOXNyc293RRAB,"Pretty tree-lined square with 2 fountains ‚õ≤Ô∏è, play areas. Designed in the French style, this green space was created by Gabriel Davioud on the occasion of the major urbanization works undertaken by Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann. Formerly Square des Arts et M√©tiers, it now bears the name of a municipal councilor from the 3rd arrondissement in the 19th century. Two groups of bronze sculptures adorn its pools. One represents Agriculture and Industry, the other, Mercury and Music. These works are respectively signed by Charles Gumery (1827-1871) and Auguste-Louis-Marie Ottin (1811-1890). The central column, made of Jura granite, was erected to the glory of Napoleonic victories.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlX1lHUTNBRRAB,"This garden is the first square in Paris designed ‚Äúin the French style‚Äù, according to the wishes of Napoleon III. A Saint-Ylie stone balustrade surrounds the square, which reveals regular paths punctuated with staggered horse chestnut trees and a lonely Crimean lime tree. Get closer to the balustrade, you will be able to see numerous fossilized shells and even coral remains in this white limestone rock! There are two basins, each composed of two imposing bronze statues designed by Davioud in 1860: Agriculture and Industry by Gumery (1827-1871) and Mercury and Music by Ottin (1811-1867). The Napoleonic victories of Alma (1854), Inkermann (1854), Tchernaia (1855) and S√©bastopol (1855) stand out on a solemn granite column from the Jura, not far from which you will discover a more modest bronze representing Marc Seguin, by Costa Spourdos (1987).
