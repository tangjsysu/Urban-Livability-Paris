ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIMzhuS0V3EAE,"A beautiful unassuming cathedral in the middle of Montmartre. It looks like a historical monument that hasn’t been overly maintained but has beautiful features such as high ceilings and stained glass.  It’s in a popular tourist area but doesn’t seem to attract as much attention as other cathedrals nearby.  Some nice religious iconography and relics on the inside.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfZ0p5SmhRRRAB,"Église Saint-Jean de Montmartre is a unique and lesser-known church located in the Montmartre district of Paris. Built at the turn of the 20th century, this church stands out for its distinctive architecture, blending Romanesque and Art Nouveau styles. Its striking façade, decorated with intricate details, and its interior, with colorful stained-glass windows and mosaics, create a serene and artistic atmosphere. The church is also notable for being one of the few in Paris constructed with reinforced concrete, a pioneering technique at the time.
