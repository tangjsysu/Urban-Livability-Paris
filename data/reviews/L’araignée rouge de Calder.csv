ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGbzlxczlBRRAB,"So I was here one time wandering around minding my own business after nicking a CD when this dude in dark sunglasses & a headset started chasing me, shoving bystanders for utterly no reason. I lost him on the stairs and these 2 goths turned up and pursued me, meanwhile their mate was dancing around on top of the walkway and yelling at me to ""Stay"". There was also a redhead I think? Anyway I was like f this and I ran to get the elevator, made it just in time and the door closed right in the goth chicks faces but when I got to where I parked my helicopter it had been stolen and somehow the goth ladies were right there. they full on manhandled me getting the stupid CD back. Most insane loss prevention I've ever met, altho it was 1997 so I could've just been high, or maybe I had a dream last night.",a year ago,2025-01-24 11:39:17.657902,5.0,Hydrostatic Toad,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103174621318932407149/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlODV2MDBnRRAB,"It is an imposing steel sculpture. Measuring 15 meters high, it weighs 75 tonnes! It evokes a work by the same artist, Flamingo, located in Chicago. This sculpture was installed in 1976, the year of the artist's death, he himself chose its location on Place de la Défense. It is visible from afar and is a landmark on the defense slab. There is a police station just a stone's throw away. Easy to get there.",2 years ago,2025-01-24 11:39:17.657902,4.0,Christophe Giroire,"1,287",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101447090601616576864/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBcTZ1RVpREAE,The Calderón statue represents a red spider and is located on the La Défense square.  It is a very good landmark and meeting point.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRM1lPWWJnEAE,A very beautiful work by Calder called the red spider or the red stabile. very close to the cnit and the old defense riding school not far from the defense police station. one has the impression that she is going towards the great arch to climb it. Calder compressions offer us a splendid work worthy of the defense district I am a fan,6 years ago,2025-01-24 11:39:17.657902,4.0,yvon boutigny,763,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117863050174934179618/reviews?hl=en-GB
