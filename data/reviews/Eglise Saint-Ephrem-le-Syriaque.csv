ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzamRxZUJnEAE,"My first visit for a candlelight piano concert this evening. Show started at 730, ends at 8:45, but they allowed us to enter at 7pm. Seating is open so arrive around 6:45 for the best seats (where you can view the piano keys as it's incredible to see how it's played). The church is smaller sized but still very beautiful. The size seems to complement these concerts as it's a more intimate crowd.  The woman performing was extremely talented and the ambiance was even somewhat romantic. Very lovely event overall (although the older man checking tickets could answer people when they greet him with a bonsoir...).",3 months ago,2025-02-09 15:17:56.464400,5.0,Re Views,86,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115337797058506805334/reviews?hl=en-US
