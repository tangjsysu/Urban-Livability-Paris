ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzLU1EMU53EAE,"Having lived in Paris over 6 years now, I can say that this beautiful library/study room is my favorite place to go when I have free time. If you like history- especially Paris history, you will appreciate the book collection of all things of historical significance that have happened in Paris since the last 2,000 years or so. If you want to work in the study room, you need to get a special library card. It's easy to do and free, but you need an identity photo and proof of address. Otherwise, you can still come and hangout in the public space which has books, magazines, maps, computers, and expositions. And the best part?? The 50 cent coffee machine!!",5 years ago,2025-01-24 12:39:31.690068,5.0,Morgan Walesh,120,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115476229335279170174/reviews?hl=en-GB
