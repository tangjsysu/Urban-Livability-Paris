ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnVtR0VnEAE,"Thought provoking. Seeing the incorrupt body of St. Catherine Laboure right before your eyes makes your Faith in the living God stronger. Incorruptibility of the human body is one of the results of one‚Äôs faith in HIM!  Apparitions of the Virgin Mary is one proof of her motherhood and how she loves us and her desire to intercede for us as her children!  St Catherine of Laboure of the DC (Daughters of Charity) Congregation was the visionary who was instructed by the Virgin Mary in several apparitions, to have a medal struck depicting the exact second apparition. With the help of her spiritual confessor, who,after two long years, finally believed her, the priest was able to later persuade the bishop of the apparition and the Virgin Mary‚Äôs request to have a medal made.  During St. Catherine‚Äôs evening meditations, after the Virgin Mary‚Äôs second apparition, She showed herself inside an oval frame, standing upon a globe with rays of light coming from her hands toward the globe. Around the frame were the words,  ‚ÄúO Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee.""  The first 2000 medals started the worldwide devotion.  When you want to hear mass in English though, check their schedule online! Remember, the chapel is small and the number of church-goers are limited at a time. You will have to stand in queue outside the DC premises which, by the way, is surrounded by famous brand stores.  I suggest you look up several articles online so you will know more about the life of St Catherine Laboure and her humility. She never, by the way, revealed to her fellow DC Nuns that she was the visionary.
