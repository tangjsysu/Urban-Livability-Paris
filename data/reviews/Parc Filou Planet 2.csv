As soon as we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by the staff, who are not only friendly but also very attentive to the needs of children and parents. The space is incredibly well thought out: clean, secure and perfectly designed to entertain children of all ages.  The play structures are varied and offer many options so that each child can find an activity that they enjoy. There are areas for toddlers, adventure courses for older children and even areas where parents can relax while keeping an eye on their children. Everything is designed to ensure safety, with padded surfaces and clearly demarcated areas.  We particularly appreciated the attention paid to details: the toilets are clean, there are many tables to rest or eat the food offered by the park (of course outside food is prohibited), the snack area is available with affordable, family-friendly dining options. The prices are also very reasonable for the quality of the experience offered.  My kids loved every minute of it and didn't want to leave! It really is a great place to spend a day with family or even organize birthday parties.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUcWV5VGdBRRAB,"Feedback on this children's playpen: Very good experience of the Park, I understood that there was a change of ownership, and this is reflected in the way it operates. The park is very clean despite the number of children present, I went there several times and it was always clean which is reassuring for the children. The prices are affordable unlike NIKITO where you need a minister's salary to have your children play there and it is free for accompanying parents. Compared to Royal Kids, it's much better organized and the staff are much warmer and more welcoming. The play structures are numerous and varied, children have room to play and it is suitable for all ages. My children are always excited to go back.
