ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5MGVLZS1nRRAB,Perfect place to steer away from the basilica crowds in Montmartre. Needed a nice spot to chill and spend the afternoon and this google search was fruitful. Lots of benches and corners to sit and you still get a great view of the basilica.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxbl8taTBRRRAB,"This pretty little spot, tucked away behind the Basilica de Sacr√© Coeur, is probably missed by 99% of the tourist throngs who make their way up to the landmarks of Montmartre. And what is being missed is one of the best and prettiest public green spaces in Montmartre: Square Marcel-Bleustein-Blanchet.  The little square was once called Park Turlure, after a former windmill on the site. It was renamed Square Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet in 2004, after the French entrepreneur and advertising magnate best known as the founder of Publicis Groupe. The square is not large, and is terraced.  So why visit? It provides some of the best (and perhaps most unique) views of the Basilica de Sacr√©-Coeur. After all, few people wander around the back of the basilica, preferring to stop and photograph the ecclesiastical building face on. Further, in the spring, summer and autumn, Square Marcel-Bleustein-Blanchet is a picture of seasonal loveliness. In summer it is filled with blossoming wisteria, while in the autumn months, the autumnal yellows, golds and reds tumble over the old arbor frame, creating a canopy of autumnal loveliness. In all seasons the little park is the perfect place to enjoy a picnic, as well as a great place to stop and rest in the middle of your Montmartre walking discovery tour.  It‚Äôs not difficult to find. As you walk to the left side of the Basilica from its front facade, along Rue du Cardinal Guibert on your way to Place du Tertre, veer right (instead of turning left) along Rue du Chevalier de la Barre to the rear of the Basilica. You‚Äôll see the little square directly ahead of you. It certainly is worth a little visit and a perfect spot away from the tourist fray to rest awhile and to be still.",a year ago,2025-01-24 13:32:15.403950,5.0,Mk Travel,440,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101092087775247231812/reviews?hl=en-GB
