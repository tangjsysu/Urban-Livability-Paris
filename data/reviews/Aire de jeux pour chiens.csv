ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMXZEd1N3EAE,"Scandalous! This dog park replaces a pÃ©tanque court that has existed for more than 20 years. The town hall did not warn us and even less consult us. As soon as we saw the surveyors taking measurements, we wrote to the town hall three times without any response from them! According to some sources, this work cost more than â‚¬90,000. However, a dog handler told us that he would never release his dogs into such a small, concrete enclosure. Especially since there is a much larger green area right next door where we see more of our dog friends frolicking there with pleasure. As we are present at this place two afternoons a week, we were able to see how useless and deserted this park is. It is even sometimes occupied by windsurfers (skaters) as shown in the photos below. As too often, the Town Hall takes from Paul to give to Jacques without any consultation with users and does not even respond to the numerous protest letters! Great example of democracy.",2 years ago,2024-12-28 17:05:45.529341,1.0,Charles ANTOINE,3,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105523246089084821159/reviews?hl=en-GB

When well-educated ""friends"" arrive then it's a party, 1 ball and everyone displays their energy.
