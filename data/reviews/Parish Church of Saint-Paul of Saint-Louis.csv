ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3dE5uZE9nEAE,"Saint-Paul Church in France is a place that I absolutely loved visiting. This historic church, located in the heart of Paris, exudes a timeless and ancient spirit that makes it truly special. The moment I stepped inside, I was captivated by the serene and almost mystical atmosphere. The church's architecture, with its grand arches, detailed carvings, and beautiful stained glass windows, reflects centuries of history and devotion.  What I found most enchanting about Saint-Paul Church is its sense of quiet reverence. Despite being in a bustling city, it feels like a peaceful sanctuary where you can reflect and connect with the past. The aged walls and the soft light filtering through the windows create an ambiance that is both calming and awe-inspiring.  For anyone who appreciates history and architecture, Saint-Paul Church is a hidden gem in Paris.

What's really impressive are the windows that allow natural light to illuminate the interior! Especially the dome above the transept intersection is spectacularly amazing! The organ buffet is a listed national monument and it's spectacular. Absolutely worth visiting this Church and soak in it's history and the unbelievably stupendous interior.

Designed by Jesuit architects Étienne Martellange and François Derand (1627-41), this is a good attraction to visit if you like seeing historic churches. Opening hours 8am to 8pm daily.  The exterior is an interesting blend of Italian Baroque, French Gothic with Dutch ornamentation from that era. It takes considerable influence from nearby Church of Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais.  The interior is quite attractive as well. Laid out French crucifix plan, the large nave includes high ceiling and is lined with broad columns. The centre altar, apse and inner dome are decorative. Sculptures, paintings, a simple pulpit and other features adorn the walls and floors of the church, providing interesting things to se within Eglise Saint-Paul Saint-Louis during your visit.
