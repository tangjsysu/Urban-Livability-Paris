ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvcGEwaRAB,"The church of Notre Dame of the Assumption (Eglise Notre-Dame de l'Assomption) is located on the small Maurice Barres Square along Rue Saint Honore on the Right Bank. It was originally constructed in the second half of the 17th-century based on the architectural plans of Charles Errard.  The Italian influences of this church are clear, particularly circular shape of the building which to a much smaller scale, resembles the Pantheon in Rome. There is a front portico which is lined with Corinthian columns at the church entrance. The church also features a prominent dome which dominants its exterior.  The interior is inherently round in shape, again similar to the Pantheon and and the likes of Sant'Agnese in Agone at Piazza Navona which was built in Rome around the same time period. Inside, you find a single room with rows of seats under the dome. Several side altars are erected with wall frescos. The main front altar is ornamental and overall nice to see. During our visit in December, there was Xmas decor and a tree in the church front as well. These were nice to see.  In the end, if you enjoy seeing old church buildings during your travels, it is worth a few minutes to see both the exterior and interior of Eglise Notre-Dame de l'Assomption while sightseeing in this area of the Right Bank.",5 years ago,2025-02-09 15:24:14.631113,3.0,Brad,"5,639",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-US
