ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzLWVLYm93RRAB,It is a very nice museum to know about the history of La Poste ( Postal Service of France). You can see all the stamps produced by France till now since the last 2 centuries. The museum was really fascinating and interesting and the ticket is also really less so a person must visit this place. You can see a lot of older technology as well.,3 months ago,2025-03-15 21:54:55.862618,4.0,Rahul Agarwal,254,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118183620553811056026/reviews?hl=en-US
