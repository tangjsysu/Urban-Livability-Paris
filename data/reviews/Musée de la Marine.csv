ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfbHNUWm9RRRAB,A brilliant museum with great exhibits. So much maritime history to take in. I particularly enjoyed seeing a Fresnel lens close up. The restaurant serves delicious food at a reasonable price - €22 for a three course meal. The view of the Eiffel Tower from our table made for a very special lunch too.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYdWZUV2FREAE,"Musée National de la Marine was definitely the unexpected highlight of my trip to Paris.  There was a lot to see, and it wasn’t crowded like some of the other nearby museums. It was nice to be able to stroll through and learn about all of the maritime history of France.  There was a great combination of actual nautical displays, as well as beautiful paintings of French marine history.  If you’re planning a trip to Paris, add it to your list.",4 months ago,2025-03-15 21:58:49.722896,5.0,Sergio Colón,191,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111526210978684865593/reviews?hl=en-US

Also, for some who likes maritime history, ships, expeditions of the 18th-19th century it is a must see i would say. Spent 2 hours here and read about only 25% of the stuff shown there.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIbEs3YnNBRRAB,"What a nice surprise! The new museum is honestly one of the best I've visited anywhere. Fantastic interactive displays, lots of interesting things to see. The intro ""dome"" was very cool. Transports you to the sea ""en plein Paris !"".  Bottom floor is a trip through French maritime history from the 17th century onwards. Found it to be very interesting.  A nice mix of facts, stories, visual displays, audio, video. Very well done. Displays in French and English!  I often forget, living in Paris, that France is a massive maritime nation. Glad to be reminded here. However, it also takes a somewhat critical stance on some French maritime missions, like their heavy involvement in the slave trade - the displays on that were incredibly shocking and thought-provoking. This is where museums come into their own in terms of portraying messages.  5*, staff were lovely too. Late opening Thursdays was great!",6 months ago,2025-03-15 21:58:49.724887,5.0,Arron Rabbitte,77,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112471697728314581093/reviews?hl=en-US
