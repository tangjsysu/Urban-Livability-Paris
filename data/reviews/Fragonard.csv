ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzNjh2X3pRRRAB,"[TLDR: Perfume good for the price, one of the staff was condescending and extremely pushy, seemingly incapable of helping customers with recommendations because she herself did not have any knowledge about what she sells]  I have multiple scents from Fragonard and like them quite a bit, that why I was excited to finally visit their physical store in Paris. While I have nothing to complain about the perfume collection, the staff made me feel like I should not have come to this store at all.  After I found an interesting scent, I asked a sale staff there if there is any scent that is similar to this. The lady did not even try to understand what I said, instead she kept pushing me to take the perfume bottle to cashier with her sale ID (I think each sale person receives commission based on how much they sell), and saying random things about the note of the scents. It took almost 5 minutes of explanation for her to understand that I wanted to have more recommendations. She then managed to offer 2 random scents that were not even in the same direction. I tried gave back to her saying it's not what I want because it is not spicy enough, the woman stared back at me and smile mockingly ""Oh are you a professional? You were making comment as if you were one!"". She then went on and explained that for professional like her, she would never used her nose because she understand the different notes of perfume and it's all in her head, that when she smells things, she uses her imagination instead (whatever the  heck that means). If she can imagine ginger out of rose and recommend it to customer, whatever floats her boat I guess.  I ended up buying the initial scent anyway, because I like it, not that this sale person was any helpful or influenced my buying decision, if any, I considered walking out of store because of her. It was sad that my first visit to Fragonard  Paris turned out this way. My friends were talking with other staff in the store, they sounded nice, helpful and down-to-earth, I considered this is my misfortune of bumping into this saleswoman.  Hey Fragonard, better training for your staff maybe?",4 months ago,2025-03-15 22:12:42.536847,1.0,Hoang Nguyen,2,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110404412151366671879/reviews?hl=en-US
