ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJM3ZyOGZnEAE,"Disappointed because it was brokenâ€¦ With some English friends passing through Paris, we went to visit the backstage of the great Rex. Everything worked very well for... 5 minutes at the end of which we found ourselves at the exit where an employee asked us if we liked it and if everything had gone well. When we told him we hadn't seen anything, he was surprised, and after explanations, he kindly refunded us. Never mind, we will go back!!!",6 years ago,2024-12-28 15:19:32.126931,4.0,Yayain R,23,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108169757790976805707/reviews?hl=en-GB
