A tour of the Gainsbourg home gives depth to Gainsbourg’s personal life. The adjacent museum provides a salute to his professional legacy.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2bHRfVFN3EAE,"It was a beautiful, yet deeply moving and emotional moment. It reminded me that everything in life is only borrowed. We come into this world with nothing, and we leave it the same way. Some people leave behind lasting memories, while others are forgotten soon after their passing. A hundred years later, there might be no one left who remembers them.  A special thanks to Serge’s family for sharing such open and intimate insights into his life. It is truly admirable how they chose to honor the memory of such a remarkable person by sharing it with the public. This was an unforgettable experience that truly makes you reflect on life.",2 months ago,2025-03-15 22:33:26.832109,5.0,Sab X,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104966525865783322069/reviews?hl=en-US

There’s no ‘mass’ visiting so you actually get to enjoy the silence of a house that was once filled with music and an incredible talent and personality.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuX0wyZkZnEAE,"My husband is a massive Serge Gainsbourg fan. Unfortunately we couldn't get tickets for the house tour (fully booked till January 2025!) so we visited the museum instead. It's not very big, in fact it's mostly a long corridor, but it is packed with artifacts. As you move down the space, on your right hand side there are a number of screens showing films detailing different decades of Serge's life. Then, on your left, are artifacts relating to what you've just watched. It's very well done, and it did take us a good hour to move through. Then you go down to a cellar area, where there are two immersive 'booths' where you can hear the music to 'Melody Nelson' in one and Serge's voice track from the song in another, along with another display of artifacts. Finally, you ascend some stairs and you come out into a small, but very swish, piano bar where you can purchase drinks and food. Then you exit through the gift shop.

If you want to go, it's essential to sign up for updates and you should create an account in advance, get on line the day tickets go on sale and be prepared to take whatever date you can get.

Being a big fan of this composer-writer-singer, I was expecting more life in the bar, and definitely not soft Sia songs on the mechanical piano.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRd1l6aGhnRRAB,"An extraordinary visit that transcends the simple museum tour to become an intimate journey into the unique world of Serge Gainsbourg. The house at 5 bis rue de Verneuil is much more than a place of memory, it is an artistic sanctuary where every detail tells a story, where each object whispers the secrets of a legend. As soon as you cross the threshold, you are caught up in the magnetic atmosphere of this place. The walls, covered in graffiti and souvenirs, still speak of the rebellious and brilliant soul of Gainsbourg. It's as if the artist has just left the room, leaving behind the scent of his creative genius and all-consuming passion. Every corner of the house is a living poem: - Musical instruments still seem to vibrate with iconic melodies that have marked several generations - Personal works of art tell the story of a total artist, far beyond the simple label of singer - The preserved intimacy allows an almost mystical connection with the spirit of Gainsbourg It's not just a visit, it's a journey into the intimacy of a sacred monster of French culture. We emerge transformed, our hearts overflowing with emotion, our minds populated with the melodies and words of this brilliant artist. For lovers of music, art and French culture, this visit is simply essential. A moment of pure grace that will stay with you long after you have left the house.
