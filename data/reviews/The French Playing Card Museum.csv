ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKLThHWGtRRRAB,"I basically came to this museum for the temporary exhibition on Pokemon and other card games. There were 4 levels. The ground floor includes reception for purchasing tickets and a shop (this one also sold sun and moon boosters - 5 year old ultra prism for 8 euros each!). Full price entry for non-Isseans is 5.4 euros. Free for under 26s. The two underground levels contain the permanent museum. The whole thing is modern and rather classy. These basements exhibit the evolution of classic card games through time and cultures. There you can find tarot, Italian games, games from other more distant countries and of course the classic 52 card games. I learned lots of things there and loved it even though it's not necessarily my thing. So much so that I went to look at my decks of cards when I got home to check everything I learned at the museum. I won't look at card games the same way now and will know how to appreciate them. Finally, the upper level is dedicated to the temporary exhibition on Pokémon / magic / yu gi oh cards. Not much on the Yu-Gi-Oh side. On the magic side, quite extensive with an Arabian Night set, alpha and beta cards, banned cards including a Black Lotus, and cards drawn in very few copies (hundreds). Really nice! On the pokemon side it's beautiful and colorful, there is a complete basic set but the flagship cards are a little damaged, then a few other cards including among the most interesting, an aquali ex from gen 3, a voltali star, a pre release ptera fossil and some holo wizards.
