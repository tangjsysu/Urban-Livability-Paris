ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3cDdPNkJ3EAE,"The courtyard of the city hall was the main fan zone of the Paris Olympics 2024. The temporary fan zone was a nice contrast between the new and the old surroundings.

There were people around if you wanted to ask questions about the Olympics or places to eat around the area. The fan zone may not be there when you read this review but the Courtyard will be and it's a beautiful structure üòä",4 months ago,2024-12-27 20:53:36.963472,5.0,Festus Ifiti jr,228,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115798935473172114503/reviews?hl=en-GB
