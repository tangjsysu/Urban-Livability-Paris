Four hundred locals were involved in the project – after all, as then-Mayor Bertrand Delanoë put it, ‘The site belongs to them.’ After much brainstorming and bureaucratic faffing about, the arcades have reopened as a multi-purpose centre for sport, culture and food.  #theexpat",4 years ago,2024-12-27 21:26:30.786174,5.0,Tien Le,8,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101143424112150893654/reviews?hl=en
