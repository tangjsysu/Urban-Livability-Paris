ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNubS0tRzVRRRAB,"A small museum in an historic building. Explanations are only in French which may be an issue for some, in anywise they are short. The focus is on the past and there are interesting exhibits. This does in no way compare to the Josephine in Vienna or the Vrolijk museum in Amsterdam. The building itself is also interesting. I would recommend visiting for people with an interest in the subject and enough time in Paris otherwise see the highlights of the city.",2 months ago,2024-12-28 15:54:05.545683,3.0,O La,503,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107177379665548030854/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKOFBQUXpBRRAB,"A small museum of historical medical instruments. Fascinating for those who that sounds interesting to - potentially horrifying for those who are squeamish.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5enFQUVVBEAE,This is hard to find museum but it is located on the third floor of the Université de Paris Cite. Cost is 3.50Euro for adults and $2.50 for minors. It is one large room with mostly ancient medical instruments.  It is certainly not one of the better museums for medicine that I have been too.
