ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYcHZDVU5REAE,"This statue is an bronze statue of Captain Dreyfus (1859-1935), the famous French officer victimised as part of a judicial conspiracy known as the Dreyfus Affair. The statue is the work of artist Louis Mitelberg and was installed at Place Pierre-Lafue in 1985.  What you see is a expressionist interpretation of Dreyfus in uniform holding up a broken sword with his right hand in front of his face. It is an interesting monument to an equally interesting historic figure.
