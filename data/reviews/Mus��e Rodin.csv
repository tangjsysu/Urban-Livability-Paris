ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2aHRUQThBRRAB,The gardens and some of the art of  museum are absolutely breathtaking and you can see more famous buildings from the gardens and around the area … However I didn’t particularly enjoy certain art pieces and I know that art is subjective but after a while some of the pieces got repetitive with some being of better quality than others The temporary exhibit had such amazing and rich cultural history but I felt that I spent more time reading the blurbs of the art than enjoying the actual art . And I feel that this sentiment is felt by many as it felt like some people solely came for the photos after being bored by some of the art pieces they promptly left and exited . Maybe that’s why there is no wait time It’s not a terrible museum but I 100% believe that if you go to Paris there are several other museums that you can visit instead,a week ago,2024-12-28 15:47:27.725490,3.0,Kaya Olwit,5,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115232780626561676935/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiMEtmaDRBRRAB,"We really enjoyed the museum as we enjoy & appreciate Rodin's artwork. You could easily spend an hour here,  maybe two. The gardens are nice with shaped trees and a rose garden. There are statues spread around as well as a fountain. The Gates of Hell were interesting to see in person to give you a perspective of size and depth of the work. The ""smaller"" pieces are inside the museum and worth seeing. There is also a cafe outside to rest and have a snack. If you are unfamiliar with Rodin but interested in sculpture,  I highly recommend you visit here.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYNW9xQ0NBEAE,"One of the smaller Parisian museums, I think it is manageable within 90 minutes, with some time to spare for the garden, which is also nice. The museum contains all of Rodin's ""greatest hits"" and offers a concise retrospective over his whole life. They even have some less famous paintings by van Gogh in the collection.  There was no wait time on Sat afternoon and the tickets are affordable and can be bought in a combo with Museé d'Orsay, which we found very convenient.
