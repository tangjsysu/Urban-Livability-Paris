There remain some vestiges of these passages still somewhat preserved, as if forgotten by the filthy mass of tourists, globalized merchants and the bad taste of the liberal libertarian left. These passages, like oases outside of time, combine the calm, luxury and voluptuousness of ancient France, radiant and modern, rooted and eternal.
