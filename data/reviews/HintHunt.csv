ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEdFlxUVZREAE,"We did two escape rooms in one evening. First we did the pirate ship treasure hunt and after we had to solve the mystery around James Murdoch. Juliette made it super easy for us to emerge into the roles and was AT LEAST as enthusiastic as we were on the missions. The rooms are well worked and the riddles are challenging, but not impossible tasks. We can only recommend both venues and the treatment is amazing! We even got a lot of feedback that is going to help us a lot for our upcoming escape rooms booked on this visit over the weekend.
