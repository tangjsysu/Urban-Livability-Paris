ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqdnJqaHZnRRAB,"As a cemetery enthusiast, one of the best I have ever been to. Each grave is so beautiful and unique and holds so much history. It’s a very large cemetery so there’s so much to see! So many fun nooks to explore different views of it all. Not too many cats but that’s okay! I wish I could have spent longer here but just didn’t have the time. If i lived here or came back, I would love to take a longer stroll around, maybe find a bench with a pastry and some coffee and just enjoy the history of it all.",8 months ago,2024-12-27 19:50:28.144128,5.0,Karlene Meier,15,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109635670639767993012/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4Njh5WVRREAE,"Morning stroll through Montmartre Cemetery.  I was amazed at how young the tombs are.  The oldest death dates I found were in the mid 1800s. The most recent was 2021. Many family crypts that may be older but had no dates. Only one way in and one way out,  surrounded by walls.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMjRyclVREAE,"Love this cemetery in Paris 18. Had a lovely walk from lunch in Paris 2 along quirky, characterful streets through Paris 9 to get to the cemetery - highly recommend if you have the time and energy! This cemetery is a good size (not overwhelmingly large like Pere Lachaise) and very characterful. You could do a small section in about 30-45mins bit would need 1.5-2  hours to cover it all. Lots of crypts and interesting tombstones. My favourite has weird mummies on it (see pictures). The Dalida is very interesting with a life-size statue. I liked the Emile Zola too - mainly because I looked him up and discovered the mysterious circumstances of his death! The cemetery is free to enter, and has free public toilets near the entrance. There are parts that are wheelchair accessible but some sections are steeper, or with steps or quite narrow.",a year ago,2024-12-27 19:50:28.149129,5.0,Michelle M,561,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104095385848067700672/reviews?hl=en

It almost felt like walking through an outdoor museum. There were people walking about, reading, having lunch; it was a nice place to just enjoy the moment and everyone was very respectful. There were many areas that were quite crowded with graves, but there were walkways to help you get through and explore.
