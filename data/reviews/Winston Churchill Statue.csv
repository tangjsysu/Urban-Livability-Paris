ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkNC1LWER3EAE,A very pleasant and worthy nod to the great man of whom us brits owe so very much to. There is nothing grand or overbearing about this statue. Just a gentle statue for the French to pay their respects to his efforts. I would recommend stopping by if you’re passing nearby.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvbExMbUxnEAE,"The statue of Winston Churchill was inaugurated by the French President Jacques Chirac in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II on the 80th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice that ended World War I.  The statue runs interesting mixed emotions, some in France recognize his efforts in the liberation of Europe whereas some see Churchill's order to scuttle the French fleet to ensure it didnt fall in to the hands of the Nazi's as an unforgivable act because of the cost to the lives of French sailors. Of course without that act sailors may have died anyway as the act protected the UK and brought America into the war on the side of the allies.
