ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYcnFmQmNnEAE,"This is a church designed by Gustave Eiffel some 20 years prior to his work on the Eiffel Tower. We enjoyed a brief look around when passing by recently.  The exterior is imposing but modest, fronted with portal and rose window and backed by a bell tower.  The interior has good lighting and space. There are nice things to see including murals upon the walls of the nave and impressive stained-glass windows.  Worth a look around if you enjoy seeing old churches during your travels.",3 months ago,2025-02-09 15:25:22.678385,3.0,Brad,"5,639",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-US
