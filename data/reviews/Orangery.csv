ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1aGZHaFF3EAE,"Absolutely stunning place. In the summer, all the flowers are blooming and you can vote for your favourite rose tree. From June-July, the Chopin Festival runs and I highly recommend you to attend a candlelit concert in this park. Bring your own water as it gets hot.
