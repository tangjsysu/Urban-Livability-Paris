Unfortunately we were separated into groups of 3 and 5 which meant that one of the groups played as a team of 2 against 3 which was of no interest as it was not at all balanced. The set up was not smooth at all and the staff seemed overwhelmed. We lost a lot of time and only had an extra 5 minutes. The games themselves were good but the organization around them was insufficient and this did not allow you to enjoy them properly.
