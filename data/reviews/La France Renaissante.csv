ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzd3MzS3pRRRAB,A good place for photos and also you will find Statue of Liberty right here. Not many people visit this place. If you walk a little away from the Eiffel Tower towards the la Seine river you will get to see this place.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuX2VPV0dnEAE,"One of the best locations to get a great shot of the Eiffel Tower or have an impromptu photo op is Pont de Bir-Hakeim or the France Reborn Statue!  The Bridge its self is an iconic Paris landmark that has been the backdrop of several movies! With the Tour Eiffel in the background it‚Äôs a great place to take photos and portraits! I do recommend going early, as with any place in Paris where you may want to have less crowds for photos!
