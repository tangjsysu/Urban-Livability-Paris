ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJMFplenlBRRAB,"This is so beautiful place what i have seen in my life. Originally stood in the Middle Ages in front of the portal of bishops and archbishops a post called ""Scale of Justice"" at the foot of which the condemned kneel to make amends. Head and barefoot, holding in their hands a big candle of yellow wax, they wore on their chest and back a double sign indicating the nature of their crime or a rope around their necks if they were sentenced to death. The criminals were then exposed on this gallows acting pillory. The scale was replaced in 1767 2 or 1768 3 by a yoke which was adopted as a zero point by letters patent of Louis XV of April 22, 1769. This point was materialized for the first time by a terminal by royal letter of April 22, 17864.  The materialization of this point in its current form was discussed for twelve years by the Paris City Council and the Commission du Vieux Paris, between 1912 and 1924. The plaque was finally solemnly laid in 1924, October 10 5 or the January 22,6,7 according to sources. It was withdrawn in 1966 and reinstated in 1972 7, in order to carry out work initially aimed at the construction of an underground car park under the forecourt, but archaeological discoveries on the history of Paris have finally led to crypt to protect them (the archaeological crypt of the Not re-Dame square) 8 .According to some analyzes 9, it would be symbolic of the centralization of France around its capital.",5 years ago,2024-12-28 15:10:16.721967,5.0,JD Titu,96,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115047633307741439872/reviews?hl=en
