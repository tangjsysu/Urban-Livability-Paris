ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNINmNPdTJRRRAB,"Le Passe-muraille, also known as “The Man Who Walked Through Walls,” is a famous sculpture located in the Montmartre district of Paris. The artwork, which depicts a man halfway through a stone wall, is based on a short story by French writer Marcel Aymé.  Background and Story  • Marcel Aymé’s Story: The sculpture is inspired by the 1943 short story Le Passe-muraille, written by Marcel Aymé. The story revolves around Dutilleul, an ordinary man who discovers he has the supernatural ability to walk through walls. Initially, he uses this power for mischievous purposes, but eventually, he falls in love and begins using it to meet his lover. In a twist of fate, Dutilleul gets stuck in a wall, which leads to his tragic end. • Location and Significance: The sculpture is located in Place Marcel Aymé, near the author’s former residence in Montmartre. It was created by the famous French actor and sculptor Jean Marais in 1989 to honor Aymé’s literary work and to celebrate the fantastical tale.  The Sculpture  • Design: The bronze figure depicts a man with his upper body emerging from a solid stone wall, his hand stretched forward as if attempting to free himself. The expression on his face conveys a sense of struggle and determination, evoking the character’s tragic fate in the story. • Interaction with Visitors: Over the years, the sculpture has become an interactive piece of public art. Visitors often pose with the statue, especially by grabbing the outstretched hand, which has been polished by thousands of hands over time.  Symbolism  The sculpture represents themes of freedom, the limits of human experience, and the desire to escape the constraints of everyday life. The juxtaposition of the fantastical with the real world, as portrayed in both the story and the sculpture, resonates with the whimsical and artistic spirit of Montmartre.  Legacy  Le Passe-muraille has become a beloved part of the cultural landscape of Montmartre, attracting both literature lovers and tourists alike. It stands as a tribute to Marcel Aymé’s storytelling and to the creative energy of Paris’s historic Montmartre neighborhood.",4 months ago,2025-01-24 13:50:37.069231,5.0,Kento Masuda,192,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106410539947371300536/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmOWFqRUlnEAE,"Dutilleul was a lowly civil servant from Montmartre who discovers this amazing ability, and he first uses it at work to drive a middle-management-type guy crazy because he had constantly humiliated him. Dutilleul then moves on to burglaries, leaving notes signed, ""Garou-Garou"" — a funny name that really doesn't translate well; ""Garou"" is part of the French word for werewolf, so ""Garou-Garou"" is sort of, but not really, like ""Wolf-Wolf""? English translations of the story have him calling himself either ""Wolfy,"" or ""The Lone Wolf""; much better. Anyway, he somehow gets himself caught and thrown in La Santé prison, where he soon has the audacity to escape to have lunch in a café and then send word to the prison warden asking him to come and settle the bill, haha. All right, enough translating. The story involves a love interest, of course, and lots of sneaking though walls to avoid her oblivious husband.
