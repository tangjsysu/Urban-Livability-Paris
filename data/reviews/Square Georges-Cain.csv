This is the ideal place for a break, for a repleneshing pause to refill your batteries.",2 months ago,2024-12-28 16:32:10.283422,4.0,Dan Maarek,692,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101092586438291424548/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKcXBUSFBBEAE,"Beautiful small square in the 4th. And yes, I am part of the dog owners that lets her dogs loose safely in the park. Such a great social place for dog owners in Paris ! Such a friendly place - unless you get a ticket from the city police because your dog is not on his leech ! Although the owners are serious about cleaning after their dog. I wish there would be more of those spontaneous places for dog owners in this neighborhood of 4th/11th/3rd : I met so many people I would never have met if there wasnâ€™t a park like that close to where I live.
