ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzOU8yZVVREAE,"Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais (Paris, 24 January 1732 – Paris, 18 May 1799) was a French playwright and polemicist. As a child he studied the guitar, flute, harp and viola. At the age of thirteen he abandoned school and shortly afterwards also his father's watchmaker's shop. From this moment he began to lead a messy and adventurous life that would lead him to wealth, success, pleasure and literary inspiration. Thanks to his marriage to a rich widow, he managed to enter the most important literary circles of the time and, with the help of the financier Paris-Duverney, accumulated colossal wealth in a very short time. Having entered the court, he taught music to the royal princesses and was appointed First Secretary to Louis XV. Having enriched himself through financial speculation, he underwent two trials, for which he wrote four Memoires (1774) against councilor Goezman, witty and lively satire pamphlets. He lost the cases, but was favored by the public for his liveliness as a polemicist. He was then a secret agent of the French court, he founded the society of dramatic authors which proposed the recognition of copyright that the National Constituent Assembly would grant in 1791, he supplied weapons to the American rebels and, after serious opposition from the censors, from the Royal Keeper of the Seals and of Louis XVI himself, had his opera Le Mariage de Figaro (1784) performed, receiving a lukewarm reception from critics and an enormous success with the public, in terms of fashion and customs. He frequented the social salon of the Prince of Conti for a long time, Grand Prior of the Order of Malta, who awarded him a lifetime pension of 1900 lire. The Revolution deprived him of his offices. He became an agent of the Convention: taking refuge in Hamburg, he later returned to his homeland. Prodigiously active in his business, he brought his experience to the stage, particularly with intrigue comedy, and managed to combine plot grandeur, social satire and grievances against injustice. He was already famous for the Barbier de Séville, composed in 1773 (from which Paisiello and Rossini each drew an opera in 1782 and 1816 respectively), inspired by a trip to Spain to help his sister Lisette abandoned by her betrothed, José Clavijo y Fajardo, but in Le Mariage de Figaro, composed in 1778 (from which Mozart based the opera of the same name in 1786), he advocated the defense of the humble, transforming it into an apologia of the people. The trilogy is completed by Mère coupable, composed between 1789 and 1790 (from which Milhaud drew the opera of the same name in 1966), an ideal fulfillment of the events concerning the d'Almaviva family, which differs from the other two works in that it is a moral drama. He also wrote two other plays: Eugenie (1767) and Les Deux Amis (1770). Beaumarchais' originality is to be found not so much in the plot and characterization of the characters, but in the personal way with which he tells the events: rhythm, cheerfulness, attitude and a spontaneous and authentic language. If the writing of his works is sometimes hasty, if his grasping of situations and ideas of other authors seems too casual, if as a theater author he is guided more by intuition than by technique, if his use of jokes are far too abused, despite all this his work has taken on a historical relevance and the theater of the nineteenth century, from comedy to vaudeville, derives from him.  He had relationships with Gluck, Salieri, Paisiello and Piccinni.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 11:40:13.669061,5.0,daniele pedroni,"1,726",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106356302369543242970/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHNHZ5YTRRRRAB,"Beaumarchais won his place as a talented playwright with his two comedies: ""The Barber of Seville"" and ""The Marriage of Figaro"". The plot of the comedies is Spanish, the action takes place in Spain, but everyone understands that the arrows of satire are aimed at the depraved aristocracy in France. After the presentation of a large scene of ""The Marriage of Figaro"" in 1784, Louis XV's brother, the Count of Provence, obtained from the king an order for the arrest of Beaumarchais and the author was thrown into prison. Paris was excited by the royal arbitrariness and after five days they released the author.",3 years ago,2025-01-24 11:40:13.679445,5.0,Ивайло Борисов,741,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115409706120393568006/reviews?hl=en-GB
