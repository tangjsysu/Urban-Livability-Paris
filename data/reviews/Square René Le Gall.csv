ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJd2JhRWVnEAE,"One of the best parks of Rive Gauche in my opinion. Several different age appropriate play areas along with a huge sandbox and numerous hopscotches and other games painted on the ground. Its a huge area with beautiful flowers in the spring and like a small forest in the city that is perfect for kids to explore in. Unlike the more pictoresque parks in Paris- this one is great because its not so heavily regulate so the kids can run around, sit on the grass, etc without being told its ""interdit""! And the best part is the great little snack bar with an extensive menu- all responably priced with seating. The only negative is the swings that aren't free, but free swings seem to be a rarity in this city!",6 years ago,2025-01-24 13:23:36.790645,5.0,Morgan Walesh,120,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115476229335279170174/reviews?hl=en-GB

But we tasted this bliss right on the bench. In the park there are tables for chess players, wicker gazebos near flower beds, I even saw a flower bed with vegetables!
