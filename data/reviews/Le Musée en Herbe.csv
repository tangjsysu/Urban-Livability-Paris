Child friendly, there was a treasure hunt game given to the kids, the staff explained the rules directly to kids, blown away by how professional everyone was, how beautiful the exhibition was!  The kids were able to touch tape from casettes, CDs, just great!  Tips: Buy tickets on the website in advance.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzX2FMVEdBEAE,"Great art museum geared towards kids‚Äînot to be confused with a ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs museum,‚Äù this is an actual museum that exists to help kids learn about art and museum visits. I visited the L‚ÄôAtlas exhibit with my 6 year old daughter and got an activity book (heads up‚Äîthey only have it in French) that she filled out during our visit and got a little surprise at the end. There are also ‚Äúactivit√©s anim√©es‚Äù that you can sign your child up for in advance if that is more your style, and again if you/your child understand French. Really it‚Äôs amazing to see how well-behaved kids can be in a museum setting! The staff is helpful (I speak passable French but got a little orientation from a staff member at the beginning of our visit in English) and very available throughout the museum if you have questions. I don‚Äôt think that the museum is all that expensive, per other reviewers‚Äô notes (6‚Ç¨/person), we spent an hour there but I could see very young children speeding through if you didn‚Äôt stop and discuss what you are seeing in each room.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1NXAzMml3RRAB,Great place for children. Ours aged 3 and 6 were both engaged in the art and activity booklet. The whole museum at the moment is exhibiting the Play with Seth exhibition over its 3 rooms. It's advisable to book but we didn't and were let in.  We went here after discovering Centre Pompidou was shut due to strike action.  There was space to park our buggy squeezed in with others.  As it's a children's place it was relaxing as the lighting was low and it was OK to sit on the floor and play the games or do the activities.  Staff very helpful and several spoke English. There's an English translation booklet of the exhibition and English versions of the children's activities both for the young and older child.  A lovely touch to gift a little gift at the end. And other fun things but I won't spoil the surprises!!
