ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeXRtYllnEAE,"I recommend this museum a thousand times! A very small cultural place, it is intended for the artistic awakening of children. For me, it fulfilled its role perfectly. Every month there are temporary exhibitions by contemporary artists (this month for example, illustrations by Mariachiara Di Giorgio, from the album ""La soup Lepron""). Based on these works, workshops adapted to each age (yes, even for babies!) are offered. The best thing about all of this? Children awaken to art without realizing it! You will also find a bookstore corner with a selection of essential gems, and even a few games.  A warm and cozy place, we quickly got around it (which is really good for the youngest!).",a year ago,2024-12-28 16:09:30.303447,5.0,Camille Garcia,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102914459603791741351/reviews?hl=en-GB
