ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYbnFHMTJ3RRAB,This bronze statue of French writer Balzac (1799-1850) which you can see in the grass island in the middle of Blvd Raspail just north of the main road junction at Vavin. It is the work of Rodin who created the plaster model in the 1890s. However the statue was only cast and placed here in 1939.  It is an interesting depiction of Balzac believed to be Rodin's psychological interpretation of the writer. Worth a look-see if passing through the area and interested in monument viewing during your travels.,2 months ago,2024-12-27 21:24:17.060463,3.0,Brad,"5,430",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwMDd6YlNBEAE,This is a Balzac statue by Rodin and it is in a pitiful condition. The city of Paris should do more to restore it- a shame to have a statue of such a great writer made by such a great sculptor to be in such a pathetic state.,a year ago,2024-12-27 21:24:17.061463,3.0,Archil Pitimashvili,225,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109603951950440503847/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzalA3bDZ3RRAB,"The Balzac Monument is a bronze sculpture of the writer Honoré de Balzac, commissioned from Auguste Rodin by the Société des gens de lettres and created by the sculptor between 1891 and 1897. The first to launch the idea of ​​a monument to Balzac was Alexandre Dumas, immediately after the writer's death in 1850. The commission was commissioned in response to the high importance of Balzac, who was one of the founders of the Société des Gens de Lettres and the second president of the organization. The project, abandoned, was only resumed in 1885, when Émile Zola, then president of the Société, was contacted by Norbert Gœneutte and Champfleury. The Société des Gens de Lettres initially commissioned a monument to Balzac from the sculptor Henri Chapu, who did not have time to complete the work: he died in 1891. The project envisaged a three-metre high statue, to be delivered in 1893. Zola then asked Rodin to take on the project, which he enthusiastically accepted. However, the official inauguration of the monument on the median strip of Boulevard Raspail, on 1 July 1939, occurred more than fifty years after the commission was entrusted to Rodin and twenty years after his death.",a month ago,2024-12-27 21:24:17.061463,4.0,daniele pedroni,"1,662",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106356302369543242970/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNybzYtM2l3RRAB,This bronze casting of a work by Auguste Rodin is not excellently displayed on the central reservation of Boulevard Raspail. The commission of this statue from Rodin was the occasion of an immense scandal firstly because of the abysmal delay in the completion of the work and then for the audacity of the representation of the literary genius.,5 months ago,2024-12-27 21:24:17.062464,5.0,Philippe B.,"1,337",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116269847449577761725/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxaXItbDhnRRAB,It is a tall bronze statue to the glory of another “immense monument of French literature” that was Honoré de Balzac. It is thanks to the support of Emile Zola that this monument of almost 3 m. high could have been made by Auguste Rodin. He took his place in the middle of Boulevard Raspail.,3 years ago,2024-12-27 21:24:17.065465,5.0,Françoise,368,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108799099049503589097/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3bXNqV01nEAE,"Tribute to the neighbor! The statue of the famous French writer echoes the nearby Rue de Balzac. In fact, he moved there in 1846 and remained there until his death.  Her house was then bought and razed by Baroness Adèle de Rothschild who used the land to build the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild.  We notice that Balzac is devoid of the usual attributes of the writer (armchair, pen, book, etc.); Falguière, who created this sculpture, placed greater emphasis on the dominant gaze of the artist, draped in a monk's robe which he wore to write.",7 years ago,2024-12-27 21:24:17.065465,3.0,Busity - Guide de Paris mobile,270,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103980295702337146289/reviews?hl=en-GB
