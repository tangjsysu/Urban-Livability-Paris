ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaE5EdHVBRRAB,"If you want to experience authentic Armenian cuisine, then this is the ideal place. That was two years ago. Today, 07/20/2024, my wife and I no longer recognize the cuisine offered in this restaurant. Their beef stroganoff from before was a benchmark. The plate that I had in front of me this evening was no longer a beef stroganoff but a kind of tasteless tamboille that I immediately stopped eating and asked for an exchange of dishes. In this case a skewer of ground beef, super salty, served with two sauces, which are no longer homemade...etc..etc. What a shame! For the note, I add that on their menu it is clearly specified that all dishes are accompanied by a green salad or rice pilaf, or fries and also fresh pasta. We ask the waitress for a rice pilaf for my wife, I choose fries. She tells us that it will be an extra charge of 2 euros for each side dish, which is not specified on the menu. We will not pay these so-called supplements. As a drink, I choose a Georgian lemonade from the menu at 4.50 euros for a 50 cl bottle. I am served a 33 cl bottle. On the bill this lemonade is charged at 4.50 euros, the waitress telling us that it is an error on the menu.
