ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKaUx6cEdnEAE,"Pericles (495 – 429 BC) was a prominent and influential Greek statesman, orator and general of Athens during the Golden Age when the arts, architecture, and philosoph, as well as Athens itself , reached new heights. Pericles' name means ""surrounded by glory"" and he would live up to his name through his efforts to make Athens the greatest of the Greek city-states. Pericles promoted the arts and literature, and it is principally through his efforts that Athens acquired the reputation of being the educational and cultural center of the ancient Greek world. He started an ambitious project that generated most of the surviving structures on the Acropolis, including the Parthenon.The most ambitious building program in Greek history, the building of the Parthenon was Pericles' greatest triumph and he oversaw the project personally. The historian Thucydides  his contemporary and admirer, called him ""the first citizen of Athens"".

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbFlUZUZ3EAE,"The statue of Pericles is located in the forecourt of the Athens City Hall on the right side of its facade as seen from Kotzia Square. It is a life-size mannequin made of white marble and depicts this great and famous Athenian politician in helmeted, ancient Greek attire holding a papyrus.  At the base of the pedestal are inscribed the words:  ""PERICLES""  and below  ""INSTALLED AT THE CITY HALL OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF L. AVRAMOPOULOS 2002""  On the right side of the pedestal we find the sculptor's signature and the year of construction:  ""OR. FALTERMEIER 1971""  On the facade of the podium was the following inscription honoring the sponsor of the monument:  ""DONATION OF ZAKYNTHIAN SHIPOWNER IOANNOUS D. THEODORAKOPOULOS TO THE CITY OF ATHENS"".  However, this inscription has been removed and replaced with what is mentioned above. 2002 refers to the date of the transfer of the sculpture from the Spiritual Center to the City Hall.  Pericles of Xanthippus was born in 490 BC in Cholargos and died in 429 BC of pestilence in the second year of the Peloponnesian War. He brightened Athens with the works of the Acropolis and his name was identified with the Classical Age and its great glory. If he had not died at the beginning of the War, it is very likely that his development would have been very different for the Athenians, since after his death there was no worthy successor.",3 months ago,2025-01-24 12:25:34.215131,5.0,Sakis Grivas,934,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113044428997774283534/reviews?hl=en

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5cktyeFhBEAE,"Pericles of Xanthippus the Cholargeus is born around 495 BC. in the municipality of Cholargos as the son of the famous Athenian general Xanthippos, victorious in the Naval Battle of Mykalis against the Persians. His mother, Agariste, was a scion of one of the most important families of Athens, the Alcmaeonids, and a relative of the great visionary of the republic Cleisthenes. Shortly before his birth, Agaristi sees in her dream that she is not giving birth to a child, but a lion, as if fate was turning a blind eye to her. Pericles, who led Athens into the golden age of direct democracy, letters, arts and culture, transformed his city with works of such beauty and importance that they were to remain immortal. What he actually sought to do was to rebuild the temples and sanctuaries that had been destroyed by the Persians and especially the Parthenon. He entrusted the direction of the construction of the works of art to the great Phidias, under whose supervision the Parthenon was built, according to the design of Iktinus and Kallikrates, while the Propylaia of the Acropolis was the work of Mnisicles.  Alongside the imposing religious architecture now coexisted impressive sculptural creations, such as the famous Chryselephantine Statue of Athena in the Parthenon (the work of Pheidias), but also the bronze Promachus Athena between the Propylaea and the Parthenon, which was so tall that it was said to be visible even from Sounio",4 years ago,2025-01-24 12:25:34.217131,5.0,Bruno Brunakias,469,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116313345260755856688/reviews?hl=en
