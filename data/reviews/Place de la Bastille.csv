In the middle of the square is the July Column. This column is not linked to the French Revolution of 1789, but rather to the revolution of 1830 that took place over three days, known as the “Three Glorious Days.” This revolutionary episode led to the fall of the Restoration regime, the establishment of the July Monarchy, the dismissal of King Charles His cousin, King Louis Philippe I.  This column is therefore a monument in honor of the Parisian Rebellion which has not changed much since one member of the royal family succeeded another member of the royal family.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzd3BPMkxBEAE,"The Place de la Bastille is a historic square in Paris, France, known as the site of the Bastille prison, which played a significant role in French history, particularly during the French Revolution. On July 14, 1789, the storming of the Bastille marked a pivotal moment, symbolizing the uprising against the monarchy and the beginning of the French Revolution. This event is celebrated annually in France as Bastille Day.  Today, the Bastille prison no longer stands, as it was demolished shortly after the Revolution. Instead, the square is marked by the Colonne de Juillet (July Column), a monumental column topped with a gilded statue known as the “Génie de la Liberté” (Spirit of Freedom). This column commemorates the Revolution of 1830, which led to the July Monarchy.  The Place de la Bastille is a lively cultural and social hub, surrounded by cafés, shops, and the modern Opéra Bastille, one of Paris’s main opera houses. The area is a popular meeting place for locals and tourists alike and is often the site of gatherings, protests, and events, holding onto its legacy as a place of revolution and public expression.",a month ago,2024-12-27 21:48:15.802141,5.0,OffTheGrid,324,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106946849861100434803/reviews?hl=en
