ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3MHRIRTR3RRAB,Great food market with delicious high quality food at reasonable prices. We went to the Italian place and had some of the best pasta and burrata.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNub1lTblh3EAE,Was disappointed to see the actual market. Thought it’d be something more bustling but it was more of food stalls. We had the worst chicken from the stall Chez Wagner. It was advertised as “grilled chicken leg” and was expecting a juicy cut. However we were served the breast portion and it tasted like overcooked overnight meat. Only saving grace were the vegetables.,3 months ago,2024-12-28 15:20:32.714366,2.0,Sera W,12,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110410781411918492103/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURweXFlQTV3RRAB,"This is Paris's oldest food market and it was quite unimpressive. We got there at around 4 pm on a Saturday, so I'm not sure if that makes any difference. I was expecting a vibrant market with fresh produce, and local foods. Instead, it was just filled with a lot of closed storefronts (maybe due to the French August summer vacation), and overpriced and unappealing restaurants, with people smoking everywhere.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkNksyb0x3EAE,"This is a very historically important marche (it's the oldest food market in Paris, dating back to 1615!), but it's not my favorite. I spent a week in Paris in September and, since I was walking distance from it, I visited three times (once right at opening, once toward the end of the day, and once right in the middle of the day) and on none of those visits were more than maybe half of the shops open. It's a covered, permanent market open daily (except for Mondays) as opposed to a pop-up outdoor market with tents/stalls/trucks, which I prefer. If you're there for the history or happen to be in the neighborhood it's worth a visit. If you're looking to shop or sample the best marches  that Paris has to offer, skip this one and head to Marche Raspail in the 5th, Marche d'Aligre in the 12th, or try any of the other excellent marches around town.",10 months ago,2024-12-28 15:20:37.005108,3.0,Krissi Pearson,70,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107130437821562764657/reviews?hl=en
