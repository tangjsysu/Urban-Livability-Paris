ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmMXAzSmdBRRAB,"It absolutely exceeded my expectations! Everything is excellently organized ‚Äì from entering the tower, staying there, to descending. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The prices of food and drinks are reasonable, and you can enjoy coffee, tea, or juice, have something sweet or savory if you're hungry or just want to relax while taking in the stunning view of the City of Light and the impressive Eiffel Tower, clearly visible from the top of the building. I purchased tickets in advance, but there wasn't too much of a crowd; still, it's better to have them in your pocket ‚Äì it‚Äôs safer that way. We were lucky to have a beautiful sunny day in December, so the view of Paris was clear, and the city bathed in sunlight.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYNXVyeW5RRRAB,You can get there by train and buy tickets on site. Their closing time 10 pm.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmb3FmTExnEAE,We really enjoyed this experience! Tickets were for the 4:30 time slot. This gave us the opportunity to see Paris from above while still light out. Sunset was just after 5pm and the Eiffel Tower was illuminated. The first twinkling light show was at 6pm. The Paris Through the Ages short film was terrific.

It's worth it  There's a room to view the city and a VR experience where you go back in time.  On the same floor are souvenirs and a counter to buy food and drinks should you wish.
