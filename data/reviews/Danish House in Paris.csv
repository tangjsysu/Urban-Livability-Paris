ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1Z2JuejZBRRAB,Danmarkshuset - The Denmark House - was the setting for a 2-day course attended by participants from schools in Denmark and the EU. Lovely conditions right on Avenue des Champs-Élysées allowed for dining and refreshments during breaks and after the course program. The large hall on the 2nd floor of Denmark House served well as a meeting room and conference space.,a year ago,2025-01-24 13:29:01.623407,5.0,Thomas Kjerstein,32,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105463620207183263788/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiODRhdnRnRRAB,Very nice and unexpected place among the many uninteresting shops on Champs Élysées avenue. Flora Danica is also a nice bar/ restaurant.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3eGVPUVdBEAE,"A charming spot, but La Maison du Danemark on the Champs-Élysées feels oppressive for climate and ocean advocates like Captain Paul Watson.

The setting is comfortable , we were a group of 6 and we were quite comfortable in the table setting. The design is modern and elegant. What did not went well was the quality of service. The staff were in a hurry, no time to listen to the customers, mistakes in bringing the required food / drinks etc. The atmosphere could be much more pleasant, including a better contact between the staff and the customers.
