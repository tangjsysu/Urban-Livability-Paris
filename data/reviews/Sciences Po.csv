It is one of the best universities for Political Science in the world, the professors are of the highest standard, and the environment is near perfect for studying. Hard work and dedication is a prerequisite though, selection can be brutal. I wish they had more outlets and computer friendly spaces, however they are in the process of renovating. I would give them 5 stars if they had proper student rooms, and at least a decent power-outlet setup. P.S.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4NHEzSlVBEAE,"Since it is one of the schools with the grandes ecoles (elite school) tradition in France, it stands out both in the country and worldwide with its quality of education. As an Erasmus student, I had the chance to study for a semester (it coincided with COVID-19) and if I were to share my observations:  1-The rate of international students at the school is quite high, this rate is stated as 51 percent on the website. The reason it has such a high rate is that all final year students at the school have to complete it outside of France, and I think it's a great system. Even though I couldn't stay long due to corona, you have the chance to make friends from all over the world.  2- French students, who are the main element of the school, are hesitant to choose English courses and you will most likely not meet more than a few French people (Of course, the situation changes if you know French or are studying at the school for a long time).  3- The school's campus is located in Saint Germain, one of the most beautiful districts of the city. From here you can go to any corner of Paris quite easily. However, even eating fast food around the school starts from 15 euros. If you want to eat at the school canteen, your options are limited to a few sandwiches, but you can fill your stomach for a very reasonable price of 3 euros.  4- The school does not have dormitory facilities, but they will move to their new campus as of 2021. (Don't worry, it is in the city center.) In the new campus, graduate students will be provided with dormitory opportunities, albeit partially. In addition, the school has a department that deals with dormitories and you can easily find a dormitory. However, finding accommodation in Paris is a problem in itself, so be sure to create your own plan in advance.  5-Unlike Turkey, the English courses I take focus on practical training. For example, while the reading load at my school in Turkey is very heavy, here you are expected to be able to explain the text you read to the class and discuss it. However, since everyone was an international student like me, they didn't care much about the lessons, maybe it just seemed like that to me.  6- A significant part of the student profile is quite elite and rich. Since grande √©coles in France are paid, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the middle class to enter. However, Sciences Po has recently offered scholarships to one-fifth of its students in order to balance this inequality. Since T√ºrkiye is not a member of the EU, scholarship opportunities are naturally limited, but it is still not impossible. Although quite limited, there are also different scholarship opportunities for students outside the EU.",3 years ago,2024-12-28 17:17:42.873879,5.0,Alptuƒü Kaan Temir,58,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114577233122822150743/reviews?hl=en
