ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURBeUtHRkZBEAE,Loved the experience and experiments here ! It’s an interesting place and I spent almost 2 hours here just exploring everything related to space and biology. They also have some animals and some cool experiments in the end. The host is really nice and explains everything in French + English if you need. However all the writing and VR is in French so if you don’t speak the language you can’t make the most of the experience. Nevertheless I still highly recommend and think it’s a great activity to do with kids or just friends,a month ago,2025-03-15 22:35:38.487375,5.0,Meshal,426,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110648341356222902029/reviews?hl=en-US

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmMS1HdDBBRRAB,"For only French speaker it is excellent.!!!! Normally it's very informative and interesting but because of language you can only see there but not understand. They mentioned in websites "" translation in 10 languages"" but be aware that the travel guide describes everything only in FRENCH and there is no possibility to get his translation.

It was unfortunate that the group in which we were was very large and included families with very young children for whom the show was not designed, and were noisy and erratic throughout.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYMXUzNFlnEAE,"The experience was very bad. Kids (8 and 10) and I thought it was crap. We would not go back even for free and if we were bored.  Every big cities we go we visit science museum or activity, exposition. It was the worse thing I took my kids to.  Small, dark, stinky, very little to see, boring presentations, 1 audio device for 2 persons with boring info, bad sound quality. We felt trapped in the rooms. It is a guided tour you have to follow with  guides and a group of people. You have no freedom to move but at the same time there is nothing to move too. The guides don´t say much and don´t have much answers.  Waste of time and money. We left frustrated, annoyed, smelling bad perfume from the different rooms, and with motion sickness from bad and boring VR.",4 months ago,2025-03-15 22:35:38.494466,1.0,Delphine Huet,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116832630043274868635/reviews?hl=en

I would recommend for 5 years old onward and for non French speaking, to purchase the audio guides as part of the tour as it’s all in French. We’re bilingual but my daughter couldn’t really catch anything the hosts were saying even the first time when the host tried to speak in English. The experience is just fabulous, a bit overpriced though. Always had issues booking online though so please could the admin look into this as this is the second time we’re coming and couldn’t book online nor talk to anyone on the phone both times and tried our luck coming in person, it worked the first time but this time we were told to wait 3 hrs for the next available slot so decided to book for the next day with them at the counter.",a year ago,2025-03-15 22:35:42.773885,5.0,Navine N,14,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106599027052296632581/reviews?hl=en
