ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3d01laUd3EAE,Staff where very helpfull as our family needed to play in english they provided us a translator to help make sure we didnt get to lost. Actors where great you can tell they love their job. The decor and costumes where fantastic our children may have been distracted with hunting for tresure but the story was immersive and compelling nonetheless.  And a big thanks for flexibility of time management and making this an extra special experience for our family.,4 months ago,2024-12-27 19:25:49.080021,5.0,Christina Latta,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114266163750664812428/reviews?hl=en-GB

The decorations are well done and really add to the atmosphere of the game. The actors are excellent ‚Äî friendly, cordial, and very immersive in their roles, which makes the game very active and lively. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game is really original and well thought out.  However, there is a small improvement to be made: the organization of entry and exit from the game. At the beginning, there are people coming and going while the game has already started, which can be a bit break the immersion. Also, at the end it's not very clear whether the game is actually over or not.  But overall, it‚Äôs an experience that I highly recommend!
