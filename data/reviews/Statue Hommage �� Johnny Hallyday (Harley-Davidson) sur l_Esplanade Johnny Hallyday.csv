ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSaXZXTXpRRRAB,"Surprising... Disconcerting... See confusing... Stumbled upon it by chance, I wasn't expecting that. At the side of the road, surrounded by tall trees, it seems very small.  But how does this represent Johnny Hallyday? He was a Face, a Voice of French song.  And there, for some, it looks like the entrance to a scrapyard or a motorcycle dealership. For my part, I see the sign of a restaurant/dance bar like Jack Rabbit Slim's in Pulp Fiction but in a biker version.  In short, it's contemporary art we'll say... Everyone is free to see what they want ;-)  But obviously, few see Johnny there, it's a shame all the same....",a year ago,2024-12-27 21:30:51.467174,1.0,Anne Le Dore,71,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107823710126718405413/reviews?hl=en-GB

And Johnny's Harley looks more like a Chinese Custom found cheaply on a second-hand site. Sorry for the artist, but my amateur ironworker neighbor would do better.
