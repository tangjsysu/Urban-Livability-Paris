ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzMXNULWNREAE,"Know before going there that you will wait a total of 3 hours and that you will be obliged to accept a loan or sale offer at 30% of the value of your items! Let me explain: even when you have an appointment, you have 1 hour of waiting to drop off your items: be careful, they do not take branded bags or squares from a famous brand under the pretext that you need the invoices but it is Above all, they don't have the expertise, because when it comes to taking watches or gold jewelry, miraculously there is no need for invoices. In short, you then wait 1 hour more to receive your estimate. And there, after 2 hours of waiting, (you are very annoyed at having waited because there are not enough seats for the number of people), they offer you an immediate loan equivalent to a third of the value of your objects. So that you understand: if you arrive for example with +/-1000€ of jewelry value, they will automatically estimate the lot at -50% to arrive at their estimate of 500€. Then they immediately lend you 60% of this €500, or €300. Obviously you are very disappointed, you absolutely cannot negotiate or even less remove an object because otherwise you are left for a new estimate and an hour of waiting....so as you waited 2 hours so you can only accept their offer of @@@@@. Important: they do not take into account external estimates from jewelers, brands or certificates of origin. I am more than convinced that the waiting period is part of the strategy to force people to accept a very low offer, you have waited so long that you cannot refuse. In short, once @@@@@'s loan offer is accepted, you will then have the choice of repaying this loan or putting it up for sale after 3 months. This is the sale option that I chose, to hope to arrive at their lowest estimate and recover the remaining 40%.

In addition, I did not find any mention in my initial file stipulating that the signature must remain identical for any future banking transaction.  I asked the question, but the only answer I got was that any document must match the signature on the ID provided when opening the account.
