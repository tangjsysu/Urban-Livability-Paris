ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuN3M3NlNREAE,Close to being the worst meal I’ve ever had. Meat was chewy and all dishes where cold - lukewarm at best. Very friendly staff but not a good food experience.,3 months ago,2025-01-24 13:25:14.725711,2.0,Kim Bybjerg,27,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106876138310262706830/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZNW8zLXh3RRAB,This place is one of my friend's and I's favorite stops! It's recently under new management/ownership. The staff is lovely and kind (and patient with my lack of French). The food is fantastic.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVN19DcU5REAE,"We came to this restaurant since it was next to our hotel but had an unpleasant experience. When we arrived they didn’t come to seat us but just pointed to an area. Once we sat down, we waited for menus but waitress would not come. We had to find them at other tables. Thankfully there was a couple of them already there. She finally came to take our order 15 minutes later. That was our first interaction with her. Granted our French is very bad but we tried to communicate the best with the waitress but she was very rude to us even though we were trying to be nice. Our whole family felt we were treated very unkind throuout our visit there. Maybe she was having a bad day, not sure. The pizza restaurant right next door was much different experience. Very good pizza and good kind service.",5 years ago,2025-01-24 13:25:14.729289,1.0,GQ Madrigal,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110798090490190586239/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2d0ktT2hnRRAB,"Very disappointing. Unpleasant, even mocking waiter. You ask if there are toilets and he answers “yes, behind the tree” while showing you the street. The formula is not explained. You say that you are taking a set menu and instead of presenting you with the different starters or dishes the waiter tells you ""I'm not going to choose for you"". You have to ask for the dishes that are waiting and are therefore served cold. The meat is fatty and not tender, the knife is not suitable. There is an error in the total (dessert is counted outside the formula although it is normally included) and when we point it out we just tell you that it's €2 less without any further explanation. This honestly doesn't make you want to come back. You feel more like a nuisance than a customer.
