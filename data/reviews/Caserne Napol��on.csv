ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzdHBTLS13RRAB,"The Napoleon Barracks is a former barracks located in the 4th arrondissement. After the French Revolution of 1848, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte decided in 1849 to build new barracks to protect the Paris City Hall. The construction of these barracks is also part of the transformation of Paris during the Second Empire. The construction of Napoleon's barracks according to the plans of captain engineer Guilleman was carried out from 1852 to 1854. In 1908, part of Napoleon's barracks was acquired by the city. The Republican Guard finally left the building in 2010. Now it houses the division and the Headquarters for Security, Prevention and Protection.
