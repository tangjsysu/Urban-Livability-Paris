ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNHBhSllnEAE,"The Monument to the Rights of Man and of the Citizen is located in Paris, in the Champ-de-Mars gardens, avenue Charles-Risler.  Commissioned by the city of Paris, of which Jacques Chirac was mayor, it was installed in 1989 on the occasion of the bicentenary of the Revolution. It is the work of architect Michel Jantzen, and sculptor Evan Thimmer. Inspired by Egyptian mastabas, it includes many references to revolutionary iconography. The memorial consists of several elements:  - It is built on a square plan, open to an internal space with an octagonal plan, illuminated from above, and its external facades are decorated with engraved texts, various inscriptions, and twelve stones with bronze seals of the countries of the European Community for the year 1989. - Two obelisks, one with a triangular base, and the other with a square base of bronze, covered with an abundance of symbols and texts containing delicate details and inscriptions, including the Declaration of Human Rights of 1789. A statue of a man wearing a toga holding several documents in his hands. - a statue of a man inviting people to read the texts inscribed on obelisks; - Statue of a woman with her child wearing a hat made of newspapers.",a year ago,2024-12-27 21:25:21.822455,5.0,Mohammad Ayoub,230,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102613109672441235778/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsd1lYVkxREAE,"The Monument to Human Rights, also known as the Monument des Droits de l'Homme, is a significant landmark located in Paris, France. It was created to commemorate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948.  The Monument to Human Rights is situated in the Parc du Champs de Mars, near the Eiffel Tower. It was designed by the French sculptor Michel de La Chapelle and was inaugurated in 1989 to mark the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.  The monument consists of four vertical pillars, each representing one of the four main elements of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, and Human Rights. These pillars are made of bronze and stand at a height of approximately 10 meters. Each pillar is adorned with inscriptions that emphasize the importance of human rights and the fundamental principles they embody.  The monument serves as a reminder of the universal values and principles that underpin human rights. It stands as a symbol of the ongoing struggle for equality, justice, and dignity for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances.  Visiting the Monument to Human Rights provides an opportunity for reflection on the importance of human rights and serves as a reminder of the ongoing efforts needed to protect and promote these rights globally.",a year ago,2024-12-27 21:25:21.824455,5.0,ChefLaurent DE,601,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108476250316059010534/reviews?hl=en-GB

The sculptures around it are quite interesting, especially the boy who seems to have a newspaper-made cilindrical hat, which also can be considered egyptian papyrus writing to keep with the obelisk theme.
