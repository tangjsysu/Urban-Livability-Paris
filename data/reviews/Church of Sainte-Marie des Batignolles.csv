ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRZ3AzclFnEAE,"Construction of the Sainte-Marie church began in 1828, under the direction of architect¬†Jacques Molinos thanks to donations from¬†Charles X and the¬†Duchess of Angoul√™me. The church took its name from Sainte-Marie des¬†Batignolles¬†in 1830 when Charles X created the new commune of¬†Batignolles-Monceau by separating it from the commune of¬†Clichy-la-Garenne. In 1839, with the population growing, it was decided to enlarge the small church, despite the previous enlargement of 1834. As a result, the architect¬†Paul-Eug√®ne Lequeux (who would build the district's town hall) decided to add two chapels laterally. On April 2, 1841, the archbishop, Mgr Affre, blessed the statue of the Virgin and consecrated the two altars dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Saint Vincent de Paul. Legend has it that a worker found a statuette of the Virgin during the foundation work. But it is safer to stick to the will of the Duchess of Angoul√™me who had wanted the dedication of the new church to be made to her patron saint, Marie de Nazareth.
