These are the Fountain of Rivers (Fontaine des Fleuves) and the Fountain of Seas (Fontaine des Mers) to the south.  These are the original works of Jacques Ignace Hittorff and were completed in 1840 during the reign of King Louis-Philippe. The two fountains are similar in chalice shape, form and composition with large stone basin pools, surrounded by figures of tritons an allegorical figures holding fish which spout water into the basins.

Swans mingle with three genies symbolizing maritime navigation, commerce and astronomy. For the creation of the statues adorning these fountains, the architect called on numerous artists: Jean-François-Théodore Gechter, Honoré-Jean-Aristide Husson, François Lanno, Nicolas Brion, Auguste-Hyacinthe Debay, Antoine Desboeufs, Jean-Jacques Feuchère, Antonin-Marie Moine, Jean-Jacques Elshoecht (known as Carle Elshoecht) and Louis-Parfait Merlieux.  They have the particularity of being made of cast iron, according to Hittorff's choice. They were to be made by the Parisian foundry Calla, but it was the Tusey foundry, in Vaucouleurs, which won the market. The cast iron was gilded for its most symbolic parts[2],[3].  Rostral columns 9.60 m high support ship's prows which adapted to gas lighting. They also evoke the emblem of the City of Paris. The same choice of foundry was made for the rostral columns, also in cast iron and produced at the same Lorraine foundry[4].
