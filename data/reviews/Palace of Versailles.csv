ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURBMzRtcXh3RRAB,"Visiting the Palace of Versailles was an unforgettable experience, despite the long wait and large crowds. The sheer grandeur of the palace is overwhelming, and stepping inside feels like stepping back in time to the days of French royalty. The history that surrounds the palace is incredible, and it‚Äôs hard not to imagine the opulence that King Louis XIV enjoyed while living here.  The wait to get in was a bit much‚Äîover an hour to get through security and into the palace itself. And once inside, it‚Äôs definitely crowded, with tourists from all over the world trying to take in the beauty of the place. However, despite the hustle and bustle, it‚Äôs easy to lose yourself in the history and the stunning architecture that surrounds you.  The Hall of Mirrors is undoubtedly one of the most iconic rooms, with its gleaming chandeliers, intricate mirrors, and beautiful gardens visible through the windows. Every room in the palace is a masterpiece, from the lavishly decorated royal apartments to the ornate ceilings that tell stories of France‚Äôs rich past. The attention to detail in every corner is simply astounding.  While the experience may be a bit challenging with the crowds and wait times, the history, the beauty, and the sheer scale of the Palace of Versailles make it more than worth it.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQcWFhcFlnEAE,"The palace of Versailles is a famous, opulent palace in Paris, with enormous, stunning gardens. Inside, the details are definitely overwhelming and there  is certainly a lot of eye candy. Frescoes  cover the ceiling, statues are everywhere and there is intricate, artistic work from floor to ceiling. The architecture of the building, gates and grounds were very impressive as well. One hall is all mirrored glass.  It was extremely packed when we visited, which was unfortunate, as it was very difficult to move inside and follow our tour group. There were definitely too many people inside and it ruined the experience for me, as I was really looking forward to seeing the palace. They do not keep count of the number of tourists that they let in at one time and it feels like you are a sardine in a can in some rooms.  A tourist from another tour group actually hissed at me, if you can believe it. Another tourist was snarky to my wife. Groups do get to skip ahead of the line as well, but it doesn‚Äôt help with the overcrowding. Expect rude behaviour because of the crowds. It would actually be easier not to be in a tour group, as you have to try and keep together.  The grounds on the other hand, were an absolute joy and I suggest spending more time outdoors enjoying them, if it is crowded inside. The statues, fountains and water features are absolutely stunning. After the experience inside, it was much more enjoyable to be outside in the fresh air.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYdk0zRTdBRRAB,Palace is nice. But garden in my opinion is much better so expect to spend more time there. Especially if you are into outdoors and gardening. Walked around for 1.30 hours  I could have easily spent another 2 hours there. Will make an effort to go again on my own instead of a tour. Tour is average unless you really care about the history.,4 months ago,2025-03-15 22:11:02.856164,5.0,Jay Patel,249,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100048605076042753111/reviews?hl=en
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfN1ppeVlREAE,"I visited during summer time and it was hot and humid as expected. Check for tickets available first as you may not be able to go inside the palaces. Nonetheless you visit the garden and surrounding areas. Take cash for the public transportation, the bus is affordable but you won‚Äôt get anywhere without cash, even taxis only take cash. I learned the hard way.",a month ago,2025-03-15 22:11:02.856164,5.0,cecia alvarado,73,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105867042427254172910/reviews?hl=en
