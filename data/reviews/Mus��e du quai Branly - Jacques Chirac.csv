ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzaGVLeFN3EAE,"One of the best museums in the world. Yes of course it’s a result of a colonial past, and the pertinent present day critique is why they have 300,000 artefacts stored up and not distributed in museums around the world, BUT, it’s still one of the best museums in the world and it’s worth to come Paris, even for a day, just to visit it. Gives a perspective on humanities non western cultural genealogy. The lighting is amazing and the headphone narrative is great too. Actually i should give it a 4 star because there is so much more potential like constant cultural platforms for by the living tribes who are represented through their material culture but…no.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYci02Zjd3RRAB,This is an excellent museum for anyone who is interested in ethnic art and culture. Excellent collection of African masks. I think there are enough signs in English to help people navigate through the permanent collection. On the day I was there it was 95% French nationals and did not feel crowded; and you have time to look into their superb collection. It’s also a very nice setting with gardens in the middle of the city.

The architectural design seamlessly integrates the building into its surroundings, creating a unique landscape that imparts a sense of entering an environmental oasis in the heart of Paris.  As for the content, which is paramount, it resides in the wealth of artifacts representing the ancient civilizations of peoples from Asia, Oceania, Africa, and the Americas before the era of European colonialism.

I definitely recommend visiting this museum as it's free if you are under 25 from EU. I bought the ticket on the day but it's recommended to book in advance. They had a temporary exhibition Mexica about aztecs and excavations around the Templo Mayor, which was mesmerizing as I've never seen anything like it. They projected a short  5 minute movie about Mexica history, which was in French with English subtitles.

We bought the tickets onsite (12€ each) and found our way to the entrance. Outside was green, cool and full of trees. Inside was nicely ventilated and refreshing for visitors coming in from the hot streets. We were enchanted by the slope entrance way with projections called „the River“ which displayed on the walking surface in a form of meandering rives. These artificial rivers show numerous names (some 15,000) of people who from parts of the collections in the museum. That was our highlight not to mention many special items of fabrics, wood work, stone work, tribal objects to name a few. One can browse around slowly for at least an hour. We were searching for a painting of our Thai friend that was in display in a special exhibition here and were disappointed that it was (naturally) removed long time ago.
