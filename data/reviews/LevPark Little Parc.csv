And to top it off, the 3 clogged toilets which had overflowed on the floor, and all over the floor.. The person who cleans, sincerely, good luck.. he was running everywhere. And....no one wore the mask. Rather seen as a disgusting picnic, than a welcoming place with a fee! Nobody enforces the rules!  Your child is more in danger than safe! Finally, everyone keeps their shoes on, (except in the structures) people walked everywhere mm on the foam mats to go see their children. All black socks from black!!!!!! Horrible.
