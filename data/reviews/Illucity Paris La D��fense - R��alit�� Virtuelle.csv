ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURydTl6RXdnRRAB,"My recent visit to Illucity Paris for the VR Escape Room was an unforgettable experience! We chose the Notre Dame Brûle escape experience, and it was loads of fun. The immersive VR technology made us feel like we were truly there, right in the heart of the action.  The details and realism of the virtual environment were impressive, and the puzzles were both challenging and engaging. The experience was incredibly well-designed, and we had a blast working together to solve the puzzles and complete the mission.  Illucity Paris exceeded our expectations with their fantastic VR escape room. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and thrilling adventure.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobG9paWJnEAE,"Decent Virtual Reality Experience but Could be Better  If you're looking for an immersive virtual reality experience in Paris, Illucity La Défense is worth a visit. The technology used in the games is impressive and the visuals are stunning. However, the experience could have been better if there were more diverse gameplays available.  While the service was attentive, it lacked interest in our needs. We had to inquire about the games available, and the staff seemed unenthusiastic about providing recommendations.  Despite this, the ambiance was enjoyable, and the equipment was comfortable to use. The quality of the products and services offered was impressive, but it would be great if they could offer more varied game options to cater to a wider range of visitors.  Illucity La Défense's unique feature is their virtual reality games, which offer a thrilling experience. But the games on offer could be more diverse, and the service could be more enthusiastic in catering to the visitors' needs.  For these reasons, we are rating Illucity La Défense 3 stars out of 5. We recommend it for anyone looking for a unique virtual reality experience, but with the caveat that they might want to research the games available before visiting.  We appreciate the effort the staff and management have put into making the experience enjoyable, and we hope to see more diverse game options in the future.",a year ago,2024-12-27 19:37:36.430614,3.0,Reda Haddou,506,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114553008799835481583/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2NzZlWmx3RRAB,"Positive point: - Variety of activities and their rather well-done graphics.  Negative points: - Impossible to actually travel (see no travel planned in certain activity). To do this you have to aim for a point on the ground. - The price: €22 for 20-25min - Staff: Not professional. Between those who forget to tell us a certain key, those who tell us the opposite and finally NO ONE to monitor if everything is going well/if there are no bugs, this is unacceptable. We got stuck for 5-10 minutes because the game was scheduled for 7 instead of 6. We didn't immediately dare to take off our headsets to ask for assistance in person, preferring to raise our hands and call them. Besides, before the game they didn't tell us what to do if we had a technical problem...  If you're going there for shooting/zombie shooting, go in an EVA. The difference will be striking in addition to actually being able to move around.

Indeed, despite the slot still open, the person in charge, who I presume to be your employee, categorically refused to take care of us, without any valid explanation. His attitude was not only rude but also unacceptable, especially considering we were punctual and willing to attend our reservation.
