ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURBNk11SUJ3EAE,"The Statue of Liberty in Paris is a smaller replica of the famous one in New York. It is located on √éle aux Cygnes in the Seine River, near the Pont de Grenelle bridge.  Gifted to France by the French community in the U.S. in 1889, it commemorates the centennial of the French Revolution.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3c0tuVmZ3EAE,"This is a fantastic place to discover in Paris if you're looking for a bit of peace and quiet in the city. This narrow strip of island, 36 feet wide,  is easily accessible from several bridges including pont de Grenelle. The island is only 900 yards long and has a tree lined path down the middle with nicely shaded park benches frequently spaced.  It's a lovely place to enjoy lunch while watching the boats go by along the Seine. Joggers are plentiful,  benefitting from the shade, isolation and flat, paved pathway. I suggest starting your walk from the Grenelle bridge as you'll first encounter the one-quarter scale replica of the Statue of Liberty. The statue faces toward her big sister in New York York and is a fine sight to see in Paris! Also, as a bonus, under the bridge are various pieces of exercise equipment and rock climbing walls. Being, shaded by the bridge and with a nice breeze off the river, it was quite cool here, even on a hot day. Walking towards pont de Bir-Hakeim, you'll enjoy wonderful views of the Eiffel Tower which is just ahead.
