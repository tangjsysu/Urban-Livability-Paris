ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGc1AycTN3RRAB,"We saw that there was very long and slow queue to enter Saint Chappelle but no queue for the Palace of Justice. So we decided to queue up here and was cleared to enter in a couple of minutes. And then we realised that we can also visit the Saint Chappelle, so we did.  Probably saved us 30 minutes of queue without the pretimed entrance. Anyways the Palace of Justice is interesting and you could enter some of the courts at certain time and quietly. Some courts are very small and you would not want to enter and interrupt the proceedings. Don't go in the afternoon if you want to see these proceedings. I'm surprised by the lack of security as well as you can even walk into many offices and files rooms!",a year ago,2024-12-27 20:56:49.875682,4.0,arChy,"1,488",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115634435298849753203/reviews?hl=en-GB
