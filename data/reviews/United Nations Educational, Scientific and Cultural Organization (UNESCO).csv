ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKMUpQUmxRRRAB,"Today, I had the privilege of visiting the UNESCO headquarters on the auspicious occasion of International Yoga Day, and it was truly an unforgettable experience!  The day was made even more extraordinary by the presence of the renowned spiritual guru Sadhguru as the guest speaker, who shared his profound wisdom on yoga and the conscious planet.  Sadhguru's talk on yoga was enlightening, to say the least. His deep understanding and ability to convey the essence of yoga left a lasting impact on everyone present. His words resonated with profound truth, guiding us to embrace the practice not only as a physical exercise but also as a path to self-realization and harmony with our planet.

It's the late 60s early 70s idea of the future in architecture, but with no anticipation, so it looks like decrepit buildings of East German inspiration borderline between Brutalism and Le Corbusier.  Toilets are small and not easy to find.  No access to foods whether inside the buildings if you are not an employee or outside.
