ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3LUtyd1ZBEAE,"This is not a department store, it’s my wealthy friend’s bedroom, a rooftop restaurant that can transport one to the south of France, a 60s living room with TVs that broadcast from the 1960s.  Service is impeccable.  The history of the department store has unique early 1800s roots where the founder sold women T-shirts across from the men’s market on the River Siene where the store is today.  He married a lady from La Marche, the other big store in town.  They never had kids but treated their employees like family.  The creator of the Eiffel Tower made the exposed internal framing. He gave much to the community and they bestowed the nickname “Samaritaine” to him for his good deeds.  Thank you Richard from Mauritius at the store for the kind knowledge.
