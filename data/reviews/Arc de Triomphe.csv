The price for a ticket for an adult is €16. You have to.climg the staircase to go all the way up so it is quite a lot of steps to climb but well worth it. If you get tired, you have enough space to stop, catch your breath and let other people pass by. Once you reach the top, you have access to a mini museum with the history of the arc de triomphe, a souvenir store and toilets. To see the view, climb one more floor up and enjoy the beauty of the city. You can spend as much time there as you want, take lots of photos and enjoy the view. Really well worth it.
