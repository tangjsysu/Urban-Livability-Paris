ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMa01mWmZnEAE,"OMG, this delightful place melted my heart! My inner child was running madly all over the place, although outwardly I remained relatively calm. What a fun, unusual, and fascinating place, full of unique history of the Belle √âpoque/Gilded Age. Some items on display were over 100 years old and still in working order. We rode on different Merry-go-Rounds, played a horse derby game reminiscent of corn hole, and watched gorgeously dressed automatons perform. The icing on the cake was our guide, Liber, who easily was the most entertaining and enchanting of the three I saw there. Even though the ticket said the tour was French only, he graciously went back and forth from French to English to make sure everyone understood. He was like a big child himself, so enthusiastic about sharing this special place with us, bursting into song and constantly making jokes. It definitely was the highlight of my trip!

The tour is in French but they offer some very helpful printed information in English. Max also lived/worked in NYC for several years and was really cool about making sure we were enjoying ourselves. It did help that our daughter is French-fluent and our grandson attends a French-American school in the states. YET, one could go on this tour without the French and be totally swept away in the magic of it all. It was like walking into the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory with Willy Wonka (Max) himself!!
