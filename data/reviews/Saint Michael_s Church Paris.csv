ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMdXZ1Z3JBRRAB,"Whether you are visiting Paris or looking for an English speaking church, stop by one of the three Sunday services at Saint Michael's. People are warm and welcoming and the sermons are interesting and thought provoking. There's a high church service at 9:30 am for people looking for a more liturgical experience. A 10:45 service (the one I usually go to) with a wonderful worship service, groups for children of all ages and a coffee and tea bar at the end of the service, ideal if you are new to Paris. There's also a new 6 pm service, with a Q & A session for those looking for more of a Bible study (wine and snacks are provided at the end). P.S. St. Michael's also has a lovely Tamil community that meets for service in Tamil at 4pm.",6 months ago,2024-12-27 20:43:02.023883,5.0,Rory Wheeler,30,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102742973705902912591/reviews?hl=en
