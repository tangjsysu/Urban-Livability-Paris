ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQbmJIN0tREAE,"This is just an amazing architecture. People from DC or London or anywhere where there are Roman influence might have seen this type of architecture. However, this is worth visiting. I recommend you to take a metro or train or subway here (whichever is available) as this is one of the cheapest and quickest ways of transportation in and around Paris Metropolitan. I recommend booking ticket in advance and then also book an audio guide because each wall has some history to tell. I‚Äôm reducing 0.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è for this audio guide. As it takes some time to figure out where to start from and the map has all the numbers but it is arranged very irregularly. This has resting places of many famous personalities. Hence, I would recommend you to buy an audio guide. The monument ticket offers panoramic view of Paris. It is very good to click a few nice pictures. However, the waiting time for getting an empty slot to click nice pictures is more than the waiting time to enter the monument itself ü§£. If you are history buff like me then you sure are bound to enjoy visiting this place. Also, important point always book tickets from an official website not from any agency as you might not find them when you visit to get your ticket (this I witnessed firsthand where a family of 6 got scammed).",a month ago,2024-12-27 21:15:09.674639,4.0,Hemanth Koundinya,232,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109869804796833041278/reviews?hl=en-GB
