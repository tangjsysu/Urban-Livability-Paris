ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdDdLN2ZnEAE,"A bust of Dalida fit for a queen, the beautiful soul with an angelic voice that sang to the world in many languages. A walk in Montmartre behind the Sacre Coeur near a park that has a statue of Saint Denis, will take you to Dalida‚Äôs house, or just google yourself there. The sad part was the disrespect of some people who grossly wrote all over the statue, yes lyrics of one of her songs, but tasteless. It needs to be clean of tagging and cleaned up, but if you overlook that, you see her home and the beauty of her in the bust, the cat you see in my photos is a cat that strangely came out, looked at us like saying hello and then left, it was such a beautiful cat and had the hair and eyes like Dalida, if you believe in ghost or whatnot, this could have been her.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNGVmTFZREAE,"On a Sunday morning, I took the metro to Lamarck - Caulaincourt . Once, I reached the bronze bust of Dalida, a singer, I continued to walk on Rue de L'Abreuvoir to photograph the scenery. Later, I turned left on Rue des Saules to view the vineyard, named Clos Montmartre. I continued on Rue des Saules to turn right on Rue Saint Vincent to photograph the steep stairs on Rue du Mont-Cenis. I continued my walk on Rue Saint -Vincent then left on Rue de la Bonne, then right on Rue du Chevalier de la Barre to see the Basilica, Sacre-Coeur. Left on Rue du Mont Cenis, then right on Rue Norvins. I turned left onto Place du Tertre to enjoy breakfast at Au Clairon des Chasseurs, while a charming Frenchman sketched a caricature image of me. See the photos, the steep walk is worth it ...I chose to arrive early to avoid the crowds and the early sunlight enhances the beauty of the cobblestone streets.
