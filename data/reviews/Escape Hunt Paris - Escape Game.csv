ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMNk1pSWZnEAE,"Laughed through the whole experience.  Me and my girlfriend played the Aladdin room. Awesome decoration, perfect size and difficulty for 2-3 people. Lots of sound effects that helped tell us when we solved a problem. Sometimes that can be tricky to know if you have solved a puzzle or not. But that was not a problem here!  The game master knew exactly when to help us out in the different situations, even gave us some extra laughs.  Big cred to both the game masters that were on site. Even got a photo afterwards as a memory to keep üôåüèª  Will definitely come back next time we visit Paris  üëèüèª",6 months ago,2024-12-27 19:36:32.249701,5.0,Robin Lindgren,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112873899922470285182/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobjQybE9REAE,Really good escape room with a different theme. We did the plant room and it was very enjoyable and very well designed with some interesting features.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Mm9iNVlREAE,"Really good Escape Room as we have come to expect from Escape Hunt.  We played Pursuit in the Metro. There were just 2 of us this time and we have successfully completed 30+ different rooms around the world and we definitely found this one to be challenging (in a good way).  Everything was in both English and French and easy to follow. We got out with only seconds to spare, so it kept us guessing for the full hour and we weren't sure we'd get out which would have been only the second time ever!
