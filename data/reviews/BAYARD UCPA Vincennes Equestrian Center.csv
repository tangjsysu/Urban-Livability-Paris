ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRdzZ2cGNBEAE,"It's a shame I have to write this review since I really enjoy going to this beautiful school in the Bois de Vincennes and there are many nice people who work there... but, the course that I am enrolled in is truly terrible and I definitely will not be returning next trimester.  Seven weeks ago I started the course hoping to advance significantly on the skills I had learnt (trot, canter, changing the rein, four loop serpentine, etc) during two weeks of private lessons in Mustique. It has proven completely impossible as administration at the Centre Bayard UCPA insisted that I should be in the complete beginners class since I did not yet know how to prepare my horse (this is a truly basic skill I could have acquired in 30 minutes and honed in a few weeks).  We have changed instructors three times over a period of seven weeks, so as soon as you get used to one, they're gone.  For the first month all we essentially did was brush and prepare our horses, take them into the arena and mount them, and then the class was finished. I went away for two weeks, and on my return, we took the horses for a gentle walk in the Bois de Vincennes. There had been no progression to trot or canter coming up to the two month mark. This seems crazy to me, it's like they want to students down for as long as possible.  There are more criticisms about the course but I will leave it there.  I am also enrolled in a beginner course at TCF in the Bois de Boulogne which is just amazing. As an indication of the difference in quality of these two establishments - at TCF in the first week we were trotting, the second week we were cantering, the seventh week we were testing our skills in a competition style class.  I'll be sad not to return to this beautiful location but I'm better off spending my money elsewhere.",7 years ago,2025-01-24 13:13:17.798030,2.0,Laura Caluraud,16,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107426834111458936012/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqOUptTGVREAE,"I was honestly skeptical when signing my daughter up for riding lessons, given the comments I had heard. However, I wanted to experience it for myself. My daughter started riding this year in a discovery class, and these lessons have become the weekly meeting she adores and longs for. I'm not pretending that it has always been easy, and that's normal, because it's a sport that requires adaptation with an animal, which is not trivial. Feeling the animal, talking to it, stroking it, preparing it, brushing it: this approach is so essential. In addition, my daughter has had a few falls, three or four during the year, but each time, nothing serious. The teachers always took care to review with the pony why and how the incident occurred. My daughter learned to get up after falls, which built her character. In addition, I notice that the children help each other enormously; there is real solidarity between them. Riding a horse is not easy, it is a sport that involves risks, and falls are part of the learning process. This sport has allowed my daughter to gain self-confidence and by learning to interact with the horse and to master the different stages of preparation before riding, she develops her sense of responsibility and her ability to take initiatives, thus strengthening his autonomy and just for all that, I validate, and we will continue the riding lessons next year.",8 months ago,2025-01-24 13:13:17.802028,5.0,Sabrina Touati,3,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116330931636690528515/reviews?hl=en

How can we leave children without experience for their first time on a pony without an adult or a competent person? At any time a pony can gallop... After a second experience in a center in the countryside near Chartres I realized this negligence, my daughter constantly had an older student near her to ensure that the animal did not appear and to guide her. Beyond the fact that the child could fall, it is also his self-confidence that is at stake. My daughter was dreading starting a new internship and this new experience reassured her.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnelAta0FnEAE,"A good place to train and where you can progress.  You quickly become independent as long as you have a really good foundation to start with (learning how to approach a horse in the box, knowing how to put on a halter, the reins and their precise location, at least knowing the walk, mastering a little trim and balance, etc.). ...).  For this nothing will be worth a series of private lessons, here or elsewhere!!! The real good starting point is a trainer who will follow you for a short period at least. Before finding ourselves in a group where we will mainly do practice...but in a group. Otherwise, the equipment is of good quality in general and the instructors are quite attentive, some of them are excellent. Large careers and rides are available for training. A place that attracts a lot of people, sometimes too many.  The atmosphere (too much traffic, external visitors wandering everywhere putting employees' nerves on edge) can be felt and tensions can build or even explode (service at the bar for example) and become completely unbearable. Despite everything, quite good memories and real moments of freedom with these very often incredibly endearing athletes who we serve above all - the horses, and around whom everything should revolve. You might as well stop by to get an idea and ask for a trial lesson.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3eDR1Vm53RRAB,"A horse riding club to avoid! On August 18, 2023, I decided to get back on horseback after 25 years without equestrian activity. As soon as I got on the horse, I fell twice in 15 minutes, the first time on my head and the second on my knee. Why did this Club give me this horse known to be nervous? (A rider who was riding with me that day admitted to me that she was surprised that I was given this horse). The instructor (Laura), cold and aggressive, forced me to get back on after my first fall, without even asking my opinion, as well as the second time by changing horses. She never called me to find out how I was doing, the Club showed no empathy and took 9 months to complete its insurance certificate, thus preventing me from being taken care of quickly. of my health costs (more than 3000 euros). This is why, last February, I went to see the director of the club to understand why he was not responding to my insurer and the latter told me that in fact, Laura was very strange and had gone to the improvised without returning the keys...However, 2 months later, he denied the facts and told the insurance company a completely different story. I had knee surgery, and today, after a year of intense physiotherapy, I have my neck and my knee back, what luck! But I'm still afraid of hurting myself, as if I had taken 10 years.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6anVMMDB3RRAB,"Rereading certain comments years after going up to Bayard I feel the need to share my experience. I was quite young at the time and less attentive to horse signals. With my current perspective and the evolution of my conception of horse riding, I am shocked by the state of mental health of most of the horses that I have been able to ride. Each horse is reined with elastics or hunting collars (at least this was the case between 2015 and 2018) we wonder why if not to constrain them. This shows the lack of consideration of the individuality of each animal. These are supposed to have specially adapted equipment. Some are very aggressive and suspicious when boxing, others when riding. They live in cubicles and spend hours of classes. I particularly remember an aberrant experience that could have been dramatic. I was riding a chestnut whose name escapes me in a quarry located at the edge of an athletics field, we could hear whistles and shouts from ball players, which greatly stressed the horses. Mine in particular got carried away 4 times during the session. It was sporty but these are the risks of the practice, the horse was very very very little desensitized and therefore dangerous but hey at least it was in the quarry he could not go very far... On the other hand during the micro walk back (in the Bois de Vincennes), my horse and others in the group got carried away because of a bike. I was taken on board at crazy speed, impossible to stop unlike the others. My horse crossed a road, reared up, a car swerved to avoid us and I let myself fall, he was caught further away by p√©tanque players.  It is absolutely unconscious to put young riders on horses who panic at the slightest movement around them and who are clearly far from feeling well in their heads.  This establishment is a business with little concern for animal welfare, despite what it strives to try to prove. I don't even understand how places like that attract so many riders.
