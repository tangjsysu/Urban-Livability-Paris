ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBcFp5RGJnEAE,"The Basilique du Sacre-Coeur (Basilica of the Sacred Heart) on Monmartre Hill in Paris is an absolutely stunning building, set in the artistic heart of Paris with stunning views of the city of lights. This Catholic cathedral began construction in 1875 and was completed almost forty years later.  It is a beautiful basilica inside and out, with two mounted knight statues flanking it on the roof. These impressive statues represent French saints Joan of Arc and King Louis IX. Watch for intricate gargoyles decorating the outside of the building as well, on all sides.  Inside the basilica,columns, vaulted ceilings and domes give it height and light inside. Murals decorate the inside of the dome and statues of angels with spears guard the dome. Stained glass windows are sprinkled throughout. Look for the excellent scale model that can be found of the Basilique du Sacre-Coeur with its working lights and its location on the street of the surrounding area of Montmartre Hill.  This is the second most visited tourist attraction in Paris and it is justified. Its location on the hill is an excellent spot for views of the city. The old artist colony on Montmarte hill is also worth checking out, but beware of pickpockets disguised as artists wanting to draw your portrait with dirty sketch pads.
