ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqdnBydHJnRRAB,"The Pont de la Tournelle is a simple, old looking bridge that blends in well with the architecture of the area (which is beautiful by the way). The bridge has literary and cultural significance and has been featured in the writings of Victor Hugo, and Ernest Hemingway. They were both talking about different bridges at the same location. There has been a bridge at this location since the 1600s, but this one was built in 1928 (previous bridges having been washed away or demolished).  The bridge has been described as 'intentionally lacking symmetry', not sure exactly what this refers to. Maybe the fact that the small northern arch spans part of the river, while the southern arch spans a walkway - albeit quite likely the walkway is a more recent addition.  Great looking bridge. Of note, there's a statue of St. Genevieve on the south side, she being the patron saint of Paris after having driven Attila's huns away from the city with the power of prayer.",8 months ago,2025-01-24 13:53:20.810338,5.0,Russell Reed,311,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111414447339049575281/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnbDVLMF9BRRAB,"The bridge is not only a great place to have a romantic stroll or a leisurely walk but also offers really beautiful views of the city along the River Seine, connecting the Left Bank to the Ile de Saint Louis, one of the two naturally-made islands in Paris. I enjoyed crossing the bridge because I was able to see the beautiful views of Paris as well as island and the famous Notre Dame Cathedral. The architecture of this bridge is also beautifully designed and catches the attention of many from above. Even at night the bridge is a popular hub for enjoying concerts with talented artists. This bridge is a great place to take pictures, as at times there are couples posing for their wedding photos with the Notre Dame Cathedral in the back, and it‚Äôs pretty beautiful. Though there‚Äôs traffic, there is not as much as the other bridges and is therefore more quiet and to some more enjoyable.",6 years ago,2025-01-24 13:53:20.816338,5.0,Ayla Kim,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117023757511887065724/reviews?hl=en
