The play area is huge, with a vast amount of activities to do, which a lot of parents will greatly appreciate as children are never bored here and spend massive amounts of energy in the process. I'm lucky enough to live close to here! It's well priced, entry isn't too expensive and food is fairly balanced too. You can book birthday parties here, I've not yet experienced one, however there are 4 different party areas. An overall pleasure to come here as a parent with two highly energetic children.",5 years ago,2024-12-27 19:31:46.554172,5.0,Louise Spencer,52,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112925816541767148471/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYeTdxczJRRRAB,"Good morning. I just celebrated my daughter's birthday and noticed a lot of bad publicity and communication on your part and within your team. It would be good to review your rules given the price. Came the day before for information with the list, I learned that we cannot choose the colors of the rooms which was not too serious given the day, the room was really basic. Then they explain to me the group makeup price: 25 euros per group and the tag: 3.50 per child. I check the boxes and I am told that the form must be returned 5 minutes before the birthday. Birthday day makeup group rate 25 euros not possible because you had to book before the makeup artist will not have time üò° Then 2 parents wanted to stay coming from far away so asked if they could pay 2 euros as stipulated on your leaflets. Answer may not be possible because there are no places ü§¨ It will be necessary to stipulate in your advertisement following places entered 2 euros for adults limited places. During the entertainment, too much time was spent playing bracelets and the cake was served just 15 minutes before the end. I describe the icing on the cake to you at 6 p.m. the parents came to collect their children and without knowing I brought in a mother with a son so at the end of the birthday. A young employee tells me I'm going to write it down, I hear it, I go to the information and I'm told that the child who has just returned to pick up his sister with his mother must pay 20.90 and that was the ruleüò° They'll get it to me before he stays outside for 5 minutes. This made me crazy and still I remained very correct and if he had been caught I would have caused a scandal. I made royal kids ones that were larger and not more expensive.
