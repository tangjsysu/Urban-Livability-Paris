Especially since there are the tombs of Michel Audiard, of C√©cile Aubry and of course, the most visited by far, that of Coluche (the latter, by its particular shape, is immediately visible, when once cross the main entrance, go to the left).",10 months ago,2024-12-27 19:59:40.270463,4.0,Jean-Christophe R√©hel,187,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110475225665671190785/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1b0wtcGhRRRAB,"This cemetery is left in a somewhat wild state so that all the fauna and flora can peacefully develop there. So no mowed grass, etc., but paths with grass, and the critters that frolic there. It has 2 war memorials, and benches to sit on. Some tombs are adorned with beautiful sculptures. Reasonable size, a good walk if the weather permits. Friendly staff at the entrance (note the period wooden furniture).",2 years ago,2024-12-27 19:59:40.271463,5.0,St√©phane Tsacas,493,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116058675413897468882/reviews?hl=en-GB
