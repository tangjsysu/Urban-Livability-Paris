ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQaklTSm1BRRAB,This monument is located just south of the entry to the Garden of the Explorers. It is the work of sculptor Denys Puech (1898) and dedicated to the French naval officer and explorer Francis Garnier (1839-1873) who was famed for his time and exploration of Mekong Delta of Indochina.  What you see is a bronze bust of Garnier in military attire. The bust sits upon a decorative pedestal with SE Asian decor and design. He is surrounded by several adult figures in leisurely if not provocative poses. It is a nice overall monument that complements others of the nautical and navigating theme in the nearby garden. Worth a look-see when passing through this area.,2 months ago,2025-01-24 11:28:11.639345,4.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTM3ViZk93EAE,"The monument to Francis Garnier is a set sculpted by Denys Puech in 1898, cast by Thiébaut Frères, dedicated to Francis Garnier (1839-1873). Located on Place Camille-Jullian, at the crossroads of Boulevard Saint-Michel and Avenue de l'Observatoire, Paris 6th. Marie Joseph François Garnier known as Francis Garnier, born in Saint-Étienne on July 25, 1839 and died in combat in Hanoi on December 21, 1873, was a French naval officer and explorer. He became famous for having spent most of his life exploring the Mekong. His career as an officer and his heroic end made him one of the leading figures in the history of the French Navy. Son of a convinced legitimist - who broke his officer's sword in 1830 - he entered the Naval Academy in 1856, after good studies at the Montpellier high school. Because of his ambitious thoughts, his courage and his passion despite his small size, his Naval comrades nicknamed him “Mademoiselle Bonaparte”. In 1873, he was sent on a delegation to Hanoi to resolve a conflict between French traders and local authorities, who refused to open the port of Hanoi and the Red River to foreign merchants. Garnier, with his small contingent, captured the fortress of Hanoi, then all those in the delta. Far from Saigon and without reinforcement, on December 21, 1873, near Hanoi (Vietnam), he was killed while fighting Chinese insurgents, the “Black Flags”. His companions discovered him decapitated and mutilated. Garnier's remains having been found and cremated in 1983 in Ho Chi Minh City, the ashes were enshrined in the base of the monument on April 23, 1987, during an official ceremony. On the base, an inscription bears Garnier's name, the dates of birth and death, as well as three places recalling Garnier's career: * INDO-CHINA, where he spent his entire career; * MEKONG, river whose exploration he directed (he was second in command, then principal on the death of Doudart de Lagrée); * RED RIVER, Yunnan river also explored by Garnier (who died in its delta).",4 years ago,2025-01-24 11:28:11.640779,5.0,Jean Marco92,642,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114146936200095763256/reviews?hl=en-GB
