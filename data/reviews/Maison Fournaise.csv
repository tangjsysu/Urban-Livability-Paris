ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwdVBqeXl3RRAB,Very nice restaurant in Chatou. It has a beautiful view over the river and the restaurant is a patrimonial building with old drawings on the walls. The food was very delicious specially the ombrine fish . They have a list of allergens. The wine was excellent as well as the service. I recommend on hot summer days.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURON2Jfd0pnEAE,"An experience of a lifetime. Le Dejeuner des Canotiers has been our favourite Renoir painting for many, many years. Before we left North America, I arranged with the staff for us to be seated at The Table- the one in the foreground of the painting at which Aline Charigot is seated with her little dog, surrounded by the others- Gustave Caillebotte, Paul Lhote, Ellen André, Jeanne Samary, Alphonse fils and Alphonsine Fournaise, et al. On arrival we were indeed seated there and proceeded to have the best lunch ever. Food, atmosphere, and service were impeccable. At the end of the meal, I proposed to my girlfriend, and she accepted. I will never forget the kindness displayed to us by the wonderful staff. BTW you DO have to really want to eat here, as from Montmartre it's metro, then RER train, then about a 20-minute walk.

We were first in and it wasn't completely filled while we were there, they might have had a party somewhere, but still. It was cold on the balcony, so waiting and waiting for ordering, dishes and being allowed to pay destroyed the experience, that we had been looking much forward too.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqXy02ZkpnEAE,"A particular disappointment. We’d made a reservation. On being seated we had to wait 25 minutes to get a menu. We were then told that 7 out of 8 mains weren’t available, and 4 of 6 starters. The waitress shrugged when asked why. There was no apology or explanation. We left. It’s too expensive to suffer such poor service. Just across the river are cheaper restaurants which have the views and the service, and don’t suffer from the highway noise. I somehow doubt Renoir would be a patron today.",10 months ago,2025-03-15 23:14:48.979101,1.0,Gareth,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111377224809616936579/reviews?hl=en
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMMUwtNkd3EAE,"This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in France. I booked a reservation for lunch four days ahead and quickly received a confirmation from the restaurant. After I had left my hotel to make my way there, I received a last minute cancellation with no explanation why. This restaurant is where Renoir painted the Luncheon of the Boating Party which has been my favorite painting for more than forty years, so I decided to swallow my pride and I rebooked for dinner that evening. I showed up and there was no one downstairs to welcome guests and no directions of where to go. My reservation was for the same time that the restaurant opened. There was a large tour group milling about in the yard waiting to be seated, so I assumed that someone would appear to give directions, but no one ever did. I eventually made my own way upstairs and found a couple of waitstaff there who seated me right away. The first part of the meal was great. They served me a delicious complementary gazpacho, the asparagus was also delicious, and the 1664 beer was the best French beer I have had. The chicken was uninspired, but OK. I ordered another beer to have with the main dish. Meanwhile, I watched from the window as my waiter obsessively arranged, then rearranged, then rearranged again the tables and chairs on the terrace below, for more than forty-five minutes! This seemed odd, since the tour group had been seated inside and the main dining room was nearly empty, and no one was going to sit outside on this nippy evening. But my courses were being served by another waitress and I assumed that my service had been reassigned to her. So I waited for my beer for twenty minutes before reordering it. Then I waited another twenty-five minutes. By this time, I had long been finished with the main course and decided I would skip the beer and just order dessert and coffee, when suddenly my original waiter showed up with the beer that I had ordered forty-five minutes before! I explained to him that it was much too late and so I sent it back. He cleared my table and I expected him to return with the dessert menu, but he disappeared again. After another twenty=five minutes of being ignored, I decided to call it quits and I strolled out to get a better view of the balcony where Renoir painted his masterpiece. There was no staff around and I got the feeling that I could have walked out of the restaurant without anyone noticing until closing time. If you love Renoir's painting, I would recommend coming to the location to see it for yourself, but skip the restaurant.",8 months ago,2025-03-15 23:14:48.979940,1.0,Robert Stone,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110095981021541594083/reviews?hl=en

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdXM2NlFnEAE,"The setting is lovely beside the Seine. However the use of what is an outdoor space for indoor dining in winter requires better heating than what was available. One end of the dining area on the enclosed terrace has no direct heating and is full of drafts. On top of that the heating was turned off when the main area which had heaters got hot....which led to more cold and breezes at our far end. Supplying rugs is not good enough at all. We really regretted not asking to be moved given we were there early. The staff were charming. However we were served hot amuse bouche well in advance of our aperitif which wete mixed up and served to wrong persons. We suspect our main dushes got lost in transit for awhile. On the food side, the menu has a strange mix of dishes. There are two menus side by side with similar options, but why have two. We took a platter to share for four for starters which had plentiful ham and pickeled fish but only 2 slices of toast for 4. The mains were slow in coming even though we were first to arrive in the restaurant. The food which was tasty (fish, liver, pheasant) went cold fast on the plates given the breeze and coolness of our corner. In spite of being told the child's menu would be speeded through, she got served after we got our main course. Her chicken nuggets which were home made were not fully cooked in the middle. I would question a children's menu that serves tartare sauce with chicken nuggets. The coffee gourmand was ok but lacked a bit of panache as everything tasted similar. Unfortunately the cold took from our pleasure and the service could be better.",2 years ago,2025-03-15 23:14:53.376105,3.0,Fiona Charonnat,286,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112229355186506566629/reviews?hl=en
