ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuMGUyTF93RRAB,When I went for the first time this past Sunday you could feel the presence of God from the very beginning during door greeting until the end of the service.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5a2RpaXNRRRAB,"I was visiting from Texas with the Nowacki family! From the moment that I stepped into PCC, I was welcomed by the warmth and joy found in every staff and member here. There was a very obvious atmosphere of love and gratitude for each other, but for God as well. The Holy Spirit was present and the packed room of people(great problem to have) all joined in to make PCC a House of Prayer. Sister Marionne delivered a powerful word on Honor before service and Pastor Baron followed up with another beautiful word and perspective on the sermon on the mount.
