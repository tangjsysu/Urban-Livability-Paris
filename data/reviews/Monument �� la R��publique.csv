ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNleW9IMFhREAE,"July 2017: This majestic monument is the focal point of the square of the same name, a proud bronze statue of Marianne (the personification of France), stands atop the marble plinth, at the base there is twelve bas-reliefs depicting important moments of the Republic in the hundred years after the Revolution.  The Morice brothers sculpted the current allegorical sculptural group that symbolizes the French Republic and was unveiled on Bastille Day 1885.  The main statue represents Marianne, the young and fictional woman who traditionally embodies the French Republic.  Marianne wears her Phrygian cap, the symbol of Liberty; she holds an olive branch in her right hand, the symbol of Peace, and a tablet inscribed with Droits de l’Homme – Human Rights in her left hand; finally, she carries her sword attached to a belt worn over her shoulder.  She stands on a pedestal adorned with the statues of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, the three major republican symbols.  The pedestal, embellished with a bronze garland, also bears two medallions marked with the words Labor and Pax (work and peace), the arms of the city of Paris and the following dedication:  A la gloire de la République Française- La Ville de Paris- 1883 – To the Glory of the French republic- The city of Paris- 1883.  The lion that lies at its base holds the Ballot Box of Universal Suffrage, below 12 bronze low reliefs that depict the most significant events in the history of the Republic.",2 years ago,2024-12-27 21:03:11.830960,4.0,Mike773 U,"1,148",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100800343478060692647/reviews?hl=en-GB
