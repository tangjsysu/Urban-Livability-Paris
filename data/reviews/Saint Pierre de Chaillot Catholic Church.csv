Will definately visit the church again someday.  A sense of tranquility and warmth is the ambience one feels when entering into this historic church. Byzantine and Romanesque architecture at its finest! I visited this amazing Catholic Church in February 2019 .It was a Sunday and just after Sunday Mass I was able to enter and visit. Immediately upon entering I was overwhelmed with the enormity of the interior! There are sculptures and decorative designs with frescoes like the one of the Moslem painter, Nicolas Untersteller. The church is actually consisted of three parts, with the tower being the most prominent. The stupendous fa√ßade is unbelievably grand. The central steeple is absolutely breathtaking! This may be a 1930s structure but the original church dates back to 11th century! If you're around arrondissement 16th, this is a must visit. Must visit this place .

The choir is excellent and the commitment (and intelligence) of the priest who follows the Italian-speaking faithful is remarkable. A crypt is attached. Masses in Italian: Saturday at 6.00pm in the crypt and at 6.30pm in the Church; Sunday at 5.30pm in the church. At 7.00 pm on Sunday it is possible to participate in a Gregorian Mass.
