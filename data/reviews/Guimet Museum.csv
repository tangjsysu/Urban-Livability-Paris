Having lived in and visited many parts of Asia it was almost a trip through memory lane, but there was a bit of confusion as to how to best look through the venue. With items in collections by country it didn't offer any flow and it was difficult to know which way to walk to best view all of the collections. I was also a little disappointed as I have heard that the Guimet owns one of the 2 scrolls that are thought to represent Hokusai's final works, ""Dragon"" which I was lucky enough to see on display next to its partner ""Tiger in the Rain"" in Tokyo in 2019. There is nothing about it mentioned and it is definitely not on display.
