ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxNDZ1RFRnEAE,"We take our granddaughter to visit many parks with playgrounds. This one is one of the BEST. It is not covered in cigarette butts like so many other playgrounds in Paris, but instead, it is covered with a soft surface to prevent serious injuries if children should fall while venturing to the next level on the climbers. The many benches that line the park are NOT covered in pigeon poop. There is a very wide variety of play apparatus for children of all ages. It is a few steps from March√© D'Aligre, and the surrounding streets provide choices for treats such as delicious patisseries, coffee, or local ice cream. Large trees provide shade, and a bandstand in the middle lets the children 'perform' to their heart's desire. There are ping pong tables as well.
