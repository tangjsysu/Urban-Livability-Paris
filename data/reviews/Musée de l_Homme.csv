ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfeXJ6X3VRRRAB,"Not the most popular museum in France (let alone in Paris), but a visit is highly recommended for those who loved history, anthropology, evolution and most of all- the best view on the famous Eiffel Tower! The design of the museum is unique and suitable for kids and families.  We spent about 2 hours in the museum and we recommended at least that for a good experience, if you are short on time, skip some of the regular collection and go to the temporary exposition instead. Those are changing frequently and can be better sometimes. We visited during the exposition on immigration and it was absolutely incredible and eye opening.",a month ago,2025-03-15 22:09:11.466513,4.0,Maayan Dahan,93,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101798047121038166428/reviews?hl=en-US
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYM3JPbGJ3EAE,It's a nice museum next to Trocad√©ro. It tells about the history of men and where we are heading. Also one of the best places to view the Eiffel tower. You can visit this museum for free if you have the CAF or for a reduced fee if you're a student. You can also see some great preserved animals in there which will definitely amaze you. It's just next to the Eiffel Tower and also it has Welcome written in over 100 languages. The museum also shows a few cultures and fossils of humans from the pre historic era. It also shows the Neanderthal skulls if you're into history of humans and evolution üß¨,4 months ago,2025-03-15 22:09:11.467513,4.0,Rahul Agarwal,254,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118183620553811056026/reviews?hl=en-US

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYeTgtVTVBRRAB,"The entry fee is 15‚Ç¨ however the museum is very small and there's barely anything to see. The museum claims to have one of the largest collections of prehistoric fossils but there are only very few, completely unidentifiable and very small bone fragments. Basically none of the explanatory texts were translated into English and the museum staff does not care that kids are literally screaming and running around the museum, which given the acoustics, can be heard on all 2 levels of the museum.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ek9lN0tREAE,"As far as I know, it was closed for 6 years for renovation works, with President Fran√ßois Hollande reopening it in 2015. I am therefore glad that I had the chance to visit it after the new adaptations.  It is a permanent exhibition, therefore those who plan to visit it either this year or in 5 years, will not miss anything.  The exhibition follows three parts, based on three essential questions: 'Who are we?', 'Where do we come from?'  and 'Where are we heading?'.  I liked the intention of the general scientific commissioner of the Gallery of Man ‚Äî to create a path, a history, for the visitor to travel.  And that's really what happens: from the human body it makes a leap to a few million years before our era.  And the road ends with a car from the 60s from Dakar, recovered from Senegal.  The one you will probably find animated on the entrance ticket, if they don't change this appearance in the meantime.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSNnZmTEpnEAE,"Following an enchanting tour of the Eiffel Tower, a visit to the Mus√©e de l'Homme (Museum of Man) seemed like an ideal way to continue exploring the rich cultural landscape of Paris. While the museum offers a fascinating insight into human history and anthropology, certain aspects made the experience slightly less enjoyable.  The museum's exhibits are undeniably intriguing, showcasing various aspects of human evolution, culture, and society. However, one challenge that detracted from the overall experience was the limited availability of English translations for the displays. In contrast to other museums in Paris, which generally provide content in both French and English, the Mus√©e de l'Homme seemed to cater primarily to French-speaking visitors.  This language barrier made it difficult to fully appreciate the depth and significance of the exhibits, leaving non-French speaking guests feeling somewhat excluded from the learning experience. While the visual elements of the displays were still engaging, the lack of accessible information prevented a deeper understanding of the subject matter.  In conclusion, the Mus√©e de l'Homme offers a captivating glimpse into human history and culture, making it a worthwhile stop on a Parisian itinerary. However, the limited availability of English translations may pose a challenge for some visitors. Despite this drawback, the museum still provides an interesting and educational experience for those who are able to navigate the language barrier.",a year ago,2025-03-15 22:09:15.714736,3.0,John L,173,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101011381237240173036/reviews?hl=en
