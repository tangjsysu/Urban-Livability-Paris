They offered a student discount on tickets and entrance was easy with pre purchased tickets.  I've visited twice now on two separate occasions and have still to see the full place..it is so immense and vast you could spend a full day there and still need more time.  Security is important, and your bags will be checked but this is quick and fairly simple.  The Napoleonic exhibitions alongside the top floor galleries are breath taking.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6b08yRFVBEAE,Would give this 0 stars if possible. Staff was RUDE and UNFRIENDLY. UNREASONABLE. This lady with blonde hair stopped us for our card checks but unreasonably told us that our cards were not accepted although we got in. We tried to explain ourselves but she kept shushing us and interrupting us. We tried to explain as politely as possible that the machine accepted our cards BUT she rudely raised her voice and had a disrespectful tone. She made us pay a fine because of that which we were extremely unhappy about - as we were not in the wrong here. We continuously tried to explain ourselves very nicely and how we were not at fault but she told shouted at us and probably started cursing in french. We were fined 100€.  Staff could have handled the situation so much better.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGcDRpUlR3EAE,"When we left the Louvre in the evening, ticket inspectors were waiting for tourists in the metro station. My wife and I scanned our card and entered the station. We learned that supposedly my wife is very strong. The inspectors were sure she had not paid intentionally but pushed the door open instead. I saw her scanning the card and she walked through the door just like always. So either entrance barriers have just a bad design or it is a tourist trap. We had to pay 60 euros. We checked online later and believe that is a fine if you do not have a ticket at all. Beware!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSb0xqbERnEAE,"Terrible experience in this train station. Beware when you visit this louvre pyramid. Every place is scam in paris, especially in Louvre Pyramid area. Scam, thief and robber. I want to share my experience visiting Louvre Pyramid. After we visit and want leave Lourve Pyramid. We take metro train. We go down the metro station staircase, and we want to find the machine selling ticket. But we cannot find the machine. We see the exit gate open, and a staff holding a small machine. We thought he selling metro ticket. Then we enter and approaching him telling him we want to buy metro ticket. He directly said we enter the area without ticket, and 4 people wearing RATP metro uniform come and stop us. And 1 of the female caught my children (9 year old kid) . Force us to pay fine 60 euro x 5 person = 300 euro. We have 5 person (2 children, 2 female, 1 male) .  We know this is a scam trap to us tourist. We said we call the police, and 1 of the staff take out a badge saying that he is a police. But we guessing he is metro staff want to cheat us. Because we have 2 children, and he threatened to catch our children telling us want to put our family in jail. We think just dont make so much mess because we are tourist in paris, and if police came, police might just help their own people. So we just pay the 300 euro to them. This is a BIG SCAM. I management to take a photo on the incident at the time we pay him the fine. My friend from Singapore also got same type of metro scam in this louvre paramid metro station.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MDRTUlpREAE,Metro stop: you don’t need a ticket to exit the station but beware of blue uniformed staff at this stop ready to corner tourists who lose their metro tickets and try to make you pay 50 euros for a lost ticket. They are curt and ready to swipe your credit card for the 50 euro “fine” for misplacing your ticket even though you don’t need it to exit. This is a scam. They also tried to ask for ID but don’t fall for it bc that’s not legal as they are not police and they won’t let you have it back unless you pay money. Whoever is employing these people need to make sure they are employing ethical workers who just seem to want to take advantage of foreigners trying to have a pleasant visit to Paris. So they check if you have a ticket when coming out of the station and then when you leave from the Louvre they try to check your ticket again after you just swiped into the station. Whoever is managing these folks needs to be reprimanded. You are taking advantage of tourists who are just trying to take the metro and these metro employees (and their less than user friendly metro ticketing system) are deplorable.,a year ago,2025-01-24 13:04:12.419310,1.0,So Maryn,192,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103672118145126000396/reviews?hl=en
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKeDVfbjh3RRAB,"Be aware, there are people at the metro station exit asking to check your metro ticket. They are asking for €50 fine for loosing or throwing away your tickets. I’m sure this is intentional and targets tourists that are on the way of visiting the Louver and have assigned hour for the visit. All the tourists want is to get to the Louver and are willing to pay the fine and not miss their entrance time. Also they are trying to get your passport and threatening to call the police and saying it would cost you €180. It is all intended to intimidate you to pay the fine.

This is the home of art and artefacts, it will genuinely blow your mind and spending one entire day here may not be enough to fully appreciate everything on show and the stories each piece will tell you.
