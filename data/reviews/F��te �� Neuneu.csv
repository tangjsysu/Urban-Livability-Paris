ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1aUlxOGh3RRAB,"Funfair which is held every year, at the end of summer, on the Pelouses de la Muette, on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne; quite easy to spot from afar thanks to the lights of its rides and the loud sound of the music played there, even from the bus line 63 coming from Gare de Lyon, and the Festival is well signposted from the metro stations; but the pedestrian access is a little tedious because of the streets to cross despite the red lights (you have to make sure that the cars stop, which is not always a given in Paris üòâüò±üò°), and the roads pedestrians next to the entrances and exits of the Festival which look more like wild trails than real sidewalks allowing safe passage without the risk of slipping or tripping, a shame for the neighborhood! This de facto favors visitors coming by car, even if they have to endure traffic jams. And young and able-bodied people with the budget to take full advantage of it. Too bad, for a popular festival üòê  Entrance is free and without bag searches by security agents, which facilitates a relatively carefree visit, welcome in these times üôè . Then, straight away, we stroll along alleys where rides and candy stands follow one another on both sides. The choice is wide, so there is no need to crowd at certain attractions because some are available in variations along the route (the Crazy Fabrik and Crazy Halloween haunted houses, or the bumper cars) and the Festival opens until late. Near the exit (the second access, when you come from the bus), there is a small stage where shows are held, the program of which varies depending on the day, and which is free. On the other hand, it is better to come early to see them, because it is not certain that the same performance is given several times a day, despite the indication ""from 3:30 p.m.) ...",a year ago,2024-12-27 19:29:37.373836,4.0,Golden Flower,"1,615",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103997385110436356996/reviews?hl=en
