ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3ck43d2RBEAE,"This is an excellent memorial. I truly didn't know about the French that were deported to work camps, and this memorial taught me about them. It's a beautiful memorial, very somber, but as you walk deeper into it, there are displays and videos going into detail about the deported. I recommend giving yourself some time to truly explore this and to sit and watch the testimonial videos they have playing.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvb05UdFFREAE,This seems to be a hidden gem near the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.  Our group was the only ones there on a midday.  This really hits home to how impactful WWII was and the impact that the Nazi's had in such an outreaching area.  It really makes you understand how life was like for everyone in the early 1940's.  Some of the information will astound everyone.  For a WWII student this will really shine as a place to have to stop by in Paris.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrOV9Ebzl3RRAB,"I’m honestly very very VERY disappointed with this place, it is not because it is a poor memorial, it’s fantastic, but their customer service is ridiculous. On the website they pride themselves on educating the public, they include information and teacher kits, yet when we arrived in a group and realized that they did not take groups. They wouldn’t even allow them to go in four at a time or two at a time. We said we would divide up and go to other locations and wouldn’t linger and they still said absolutely not. I don’t understand why a memorial would refuse people from paying their respects ESPECIALLY when they are abiding by your rules. Terrible customer service.
