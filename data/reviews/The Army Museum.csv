ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzejdDSjJBRRAB,This is the most complete collection of military history I have seen in one place. Walking through the centuries of warfare and French influence around the globe through the methods and tools of war. It is amazing to see how the technology and methods have evolved over time. We spent over 7 hours here capping the visit off with the tomb of Napoleon. This elaborate resting place is both an example of the opulence of the French rulers and a reminder of the excess that the French people rose up against. A Mecca for military history buffs.,a month ago,2024-12-28 15:44:32.269191,5.0,Timothy Carmon,73,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115794649419268545207/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIbElqdzl3RRAB,"We had an absolutely fantastic time visiting the Army Museum in Paris! This museum is a treasure trove of history, with an impressive collection that spans several centuries. From the moment we walked in, we were captivated by the breadth and depth of the exhibits, which cover everything from medieval armor to modern warfare.  One of the highlights for us was the stunning collection of armor and weaponry. The displays are incredibly well-preserved and presented in a way that really brings history to life. We also enjoyed exploring the sections dedicated to the World Wars, which were both informative and moving. The museum does an excellent job of combining historical artifacts with multimedia presentations to create a truly engaging experience.  For those planning a visit, I recommend setting aside at least 2-3 hours to fully appreciate everything, as the museum is quite large and there‚Äôs so much to see. Arriving early in the day can help you avoid the crowds, especially if you want to take your time in the more popular exhibits. Don‚Äôt miss the opportunity to visit Napoleon‚Äôs Tomb, which is part of the same complex and makes for a perfect combination with the museum. Consider getting the audio guide, which provides additional context and insights that really enhance the experience. Lastly, since there‚Äôs a lot of walking involved, be sure to wear comfortable shoes.  Overall, the Army Museum is a must-visit for anyone interested in military history or just looking for a unique cultural experience in Paris. We left with a deeper appreciation for history and a sense of awe at the incredible artifacts on display.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3M3FlZi1RRRAB,One of the best museums to visit in Paris if you want to know their history. It perfectly portrays the history of france during World War 1 and World War 2. You get to know the evolution of France over the years. It is also one of the most beautiful museums you'll see in Paris and is a must visit when coming here. It'll take you around 3 hours to explore completely and you can have lunch in the two cafeterias inside the Museum. The entire museum is Marvelous. It also has tombs of some famous people and kings.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzcmVPSlN3EAE,"This museum is staggering in its size and quite poorly laid out. Such that you must backtrack so many times if you wanted to look everything. The good news is that you don‚Äôt need to look at everything, because there are hundreds of repeated objects. The format is not particularly coherent. I would recommend to this museum that less is more. Just because you have a thousand swords doesn‚Äôt mean they all need to be on display. The elevators are slow and inaccessible, the toilets are few and far between, and there‚Äôs only one place to borrow a wheelchair which makes getting one quite hard if you come in the Seine side (enter by Napoleons Tomb if you need a wheelchair). If you are able bodied, speak French (translations are limited) and have 8 hours that you want to spend looking at military stuff, this is the place for you. Napoleon‚Äôs tomb was much to opulent, although it was a sight to behold. The staff were all quite Onery and unhelpful. None of them cared that my wife was 28 weeks pregnant except one guy.
