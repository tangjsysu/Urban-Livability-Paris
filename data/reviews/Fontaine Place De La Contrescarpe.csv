I had the pleasure of living here with my wife and daughters, in an apartment overlooking the fountain, at the head of Rue Mouffetard (the oldest street in Paris). We were in the same building where Hemingway lived in the early 1920s at No. 74 rue du Cardinal-Lemoine and near were James Joyce wrote Ulysses. Watching the holidays come and go, the sounds of the hustle and bustle and occasional street musicians.
