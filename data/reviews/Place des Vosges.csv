ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3d051a09REAE,"Place des Vosges is one of Paris's most charming and historic squares, located in the Marais district. Commissioned by King Henry IV in 1605, it is recognized as the oldest planned square in Paris, designed as part of a project to create a royal residence that would symbolize the grandeur of the monarchy. The square was originally called Place Royale, but it was renamed in 1799 in honor of the Vosges department, which was the first to pay taxes to the French government after the Revolution.  The architectural design of Place des Vosges is a stunning example of early 17th-century French classical style. The square is characterized by its uniform red-brick buildings with arched facades, charming slate roofs, and beautiful gardens at its center. Each of the 36 identical houses surrounding the square features a distinctive wrought-iron balcony, creating a harmonious and symmetrical appearance.  Historically, Place des Vosges has been a gathering place for the elite and intellectuals. Notably, it was home to several famous figures, including the renowned writer Victor Hugo, who resided at number 6 during the 19th century. The square has been a backdrop for many important social and cultural events over the centuries, reflecting the vibrant life of Paris.  Today, Place des Vosges remains a beloved destination for both locals and tourists. The square is surrounded by cafes, art galleries, and boutiques, making it a perfect spot to relax and soak in the Parisian atmosphere. The beautifully landscaped gardens provide a peaceful retreat from the bustling city, attracting visitors who come to enjoy picnics, leisurely strolls, and artistic performances.  With its rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant ambiance, Place des Vosges continues to be a highlight of Paris, embodying the city's artistic spirit and historical significance.",4 months ago,2024-12-27 21:42:02.178330,5.0,King King,260,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114313688980766135457/reviews?hl=en
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzdDhHbjN3RRAB,"Refined. Paris’s original ""it"" spot for those who appreciate a touch of aristocratic charm with their urban strolls. Nestled in the Marais, Place des Vosges is the city’s oldest planned square, and, dare I say, still its most perfect. It reminds us Henri IV…  The symmetry of the red-brick facades, the manicured lawns, and the arcades that exude an effortless old-world charm.  Not a place for hurried tourists seeking Eiffel Tower selfies; it’s for the connoisseur who prefers their people-watching with a side of French and literary history (Victor Hugo’s house is here, naturally, at former Hôtel de Rohan). At Place des Vosges, fountains bubble softly, and the pigeons are impossibly chic.  The boutiques and cafés under the arcades cater to those who think ""casual"" as splurging on chocolates and art. Sitting on a bench here feels less like resting and more like a silent poise contest.  In short, Place des Vosges is perfect, for those who know how to appreciate it. Cardinal Richelieu was a fan too.",a month ago,2024-12-27 21:42:02.178330,5.0,Francisco S,8,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106005133639521710081/reviews?hl=en
