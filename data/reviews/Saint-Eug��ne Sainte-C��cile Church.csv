ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzXzV2aDRBRRAB,"I went to Saint Eugene Sainte Cecile church in Montmartre since I read somewhere that their Sunday High Mass is spectacular - an ‚ÄúExtraordinary Form of the Roman Rite‚Äù.  90 minutes, priest, 6 sub priests, 4 altar boys, organist and choir.  Church is neo-gothic style/decor and the ‚Äúchoir is one of the best in France.‚Äú  Lots of singing and rituals.  Church itself was very interesting decor - built in 1854/55 when medieval art was rediscovered and neo-gothic churches were built across the country.  Metal framework was used which was painted in red, green and gold with embellishments; dark wood carved railings etc.  However, I didn‚Äôt feel right looking around too much due to the solemnity and because everyone else was there for spiritual reasons.",a month ago,2024-12-27 20:25:51.850866,5.0,Victoria Ruehl,30,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100697857805708395974/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOczRqSGpBRRAB,"In neo-Gothic style, it was built in the mid-19th century. However, being located just opposite the Conservatory of Music and Dance already present, in order not to disturb the students, it was decided that this church would not have a bell tower! After this original discovery, the surprise continues inside. We quickly notice the numerous slender columns painted in cast iron. It is the first building built with these materials. The finesse of these columns gives an impression of lightness and grandeur.¬†The eye is quickly caught by the light provided by the numerous stained glass windows on either side. The choir, lit by 3 large windows, the paintings, the side chapels, the aisles, the pulpit, the statues, etc... everything contributes to the beauty of the place. The marriage of Jules Verne was celebrated in this church which also offers masses in Latin, and even ‚ÄúGregorian vespers‚Äù on Sundays!

The neo-Gothic architecture is simply breathtaking, with its majestic vaults and colorful stained glass windows that let in soft, soothing light. The interior of the church is richly decorated, with frescoes and sculptures that tell biblical stories and scenes from the lives of the saints. I particularly appreciated the organ, whose powerful and melodious sounds resonate beautifully in the acoustics of the church. The church staff was very welcoming and ready to answer all my questions about the history and particularities of this sacred place. I also had the chance to attend a mass, which added a spiritual dimension to my visit. In summary, the Saint-Eug√®ne-Sainte-C√©cile church is a true hidden gem in the heart of Paris.
