Father Roder took very good care of the young people, there was non-stop patronage, catechism, pilgrimages and spiritual evenings were organized. The Parish Festival Les Follies de Saint Georges twice a year was a success, also at the end of the year Saint Nicolas. He leaves his children who have always followed him, but who will not be forgotten and hopes that they will continue to do what they have started. Father Roder took initiatives in the right direction, he leaves a Parish full of life.
