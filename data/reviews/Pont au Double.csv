ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQbDR5S3Z3RRAB,"It was an amazing sight. Me and a bunch of friends came out of exploring through the Paris Catacombs beneath the city, in which we had to find a key, break a few walls, and fight some weird dudes who were trying to eat us. Eventually, we got out through a cellar. It was night time and the rain was pouring heavy. For some reason, there were barricades on both the road and the bridge, with some dude named ""Jean"", standing, explaining to us we had to hold the bridge so they could evacuate Parisians, like what? Aside from that, Jean told us we would get a free ferry once the sounds of the bell at the Notre-Dam rang. With this, me and my friends noticed a bunch of the weird dudes from the cellar trying to storm the bridge, so we did what we had to do, holding the line. Jean even gave us some cannons for fun! What a kind man! As we held back the weird dudes who were trying to eat us, the Notre-Dam bell-tower rang, but a little while before we heard some kind of classical-music song playing, which I don't know the source it came from, but it was refreshing and it motivated us to fight the weird dudes who were trying to eat us. All in all, after the Bell tower rang, we noticed a ferry approaching below the bridge. After holding one last time, we jumped off the bridge and onto the ferry, which conveniently had hay bales, to which we landed on, although one of my friends missed, landing on the boat and breaking his leg, in which we unfortunately put him out of his misery, with another one of my friends evacuating too late and falling into the water (He couldn't swim.). Aside from the weird dudes who were trying to eat us. We had an awesome time near the bridge. There was even a barbershop and a cafe, which we didn't have time for (Since we were fighting the weird dudes). Nice place, to be honest. Wonder where that guy named Jean went.",3 weeks ago,2024-12-28 15:16:44.924655,5.0,Gavin,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103765476870149666674/reviews?hl=en-GB

It has security that for some reason wear Napoleonic era clothing and wield what i think to be real flintlocks, they also sometimes put on a rather realistic show of fighting these so called grey-ish ""Flesh Eating"" cannibals. the show was nice till perhaps a bit too much of them showed up and the guards started using the cannons they conveniently placed facing the streets at the crowd and having to tell everyone (including myself) to land on a boat crossing the bridge.
