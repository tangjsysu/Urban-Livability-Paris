ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuclBHVUZREAE,"Maybe I‚Äôm an anomaly - I‚Äôm vegetarian, no meat, no fish. I had the Linguini without Chicken, and it was so average. The portion was very less, but filling because it was a lot of cheese with pasta. There were barely any mushrooms in it - almost looked shredded. So I paid the complete ‚Ç¨19 for it with nothing but cheese and pasta. There was some confusion about bottled or tap water, so we ended paying for that also. Please be careful and stress what you want, sometimes I feel it might have been intentional but I can‚Äôt say. My friend had a prawn dish and she liked it, though we thought this place is very overpriced and missable.
