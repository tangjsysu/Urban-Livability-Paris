ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYcThqY1d3EAE,"Travelling across Pont de L'Alma one cannot unsee the Golden Onion Domes that top the Orthodox Russian Church to the right side. Although not in keeping with most of the architecture one associates with Paris, it stands as a reminder that the city hosts congregations, from all denominations of the world, that worship  and work here. There are plenty of other places to pray without decrying this one.",2 months ago,2024-12-27 20:48:20.121472,5.0,Mike Day,280,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101631451196518773367/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobF9xaUR3EAE,"At first glance I thought it was a mosque until I noticed the crosses on its top, it's common for orthodox church to have an onion dome. Its golden domes are eye catching even when you pass by the other side of Seine near Pont de L'Alma. Too bad that the church and other parts of the Centre Spirituel et Culturel Orthodoxe Russe were shut down, seemed to be an act of cancelling Russia for its invasion on Ukraine. I mean unless the church is talking politics, putting a line around the area to indicate its closing is just sad.",a year ago,2024-12-27 20:48:20.122472,5.0,Martiana Sipahutar,659,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106957497876505569508/reviews?hl=en-GB
