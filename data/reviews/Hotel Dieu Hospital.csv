ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmeU1lbUZBEAE,"I had to visit the emergency room for the first time ever, and I was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency of this hospital. I've been living and working in France for four years now, and this was the best medical treatment I've ever had in Paris. I was admitted, treated, and given clearance to leave (with my full treatment plan) in less than 6 hours. The night nurses and doctors had incredible bedside manners. I highly recommend this hospital for emergency visits.",a month ago,2025-02-09 15:22:28.463828,5.0,Ember Langley,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111815061463064815536/reviews?hl=en-US

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEeTVtOHZ3RRAB,"I would not recommend this hospital if you are looking for any kind of walk-in care. I am fluent in basic French but have a limited medical vocabulary. The physician/interne I waited 2 hours to see seemed impatient, making little effort to indicate if she understood what I was saying (in French) about my injury or concerns. I know many of the other staff were able to speak English, but I was only met with someone who apparently didn't. I understand my injury may have been less severe than some of the other patients', but I would not have wasted vacation time in the middle of Paris at a hospital if I hadn't felt it was necessary. This intern walked out of the room rudely and left me to show myself out.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBeW9MU25RRRAB,"Lousy patient care We were visiting Paris from Canada. My husband had ear pain and headache so we went to the emergency room of the hospital. The front desk personnel and the nurse were very helpful, they took care of us immediately; filled the forms, took the vitals in time etc.  Unfortunately my husband was in one of the examination rooms for over 2 hours because the doctor in charge, Dr A F, came a few times to the door of the examination room then left without talking to my husband and in the meantime she had time to spend chatting and walking down the hall and seemingly not examining patients in a timely manner nor in priority order when medical conditions are equal in seriousness.  In the end she did finally see my husband and prescribed some topical antibiotic which really did not help and was not necessarily efficacious.  I was disappointed by this medical care and did not expect it. I am a physician and  in my judgement it was unacceptable care.",9 years ago,2025-02-09 15:22:28.469828,1.0,oana popescu,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102426284967185439837/reviews?hl=en

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzNnZXZmtBRRAB,"My mother and I went here 3 years ago now because she had a retinal tear in one of her eyes. Having had one before in the other eye she knew what it was and we saw this hospital has an emergency room specifically for eye issues. We waited around 5 or 6 hours to be seen since it was very busy but once seen the doctor spoke great English and confirmed she had a retinal tear. He told us to come back the next morning first thing to have the eye surgery to repair it. We came back the next morning and did not have to wait at all before our doctor (who seemed very young) came to get us and led us to the room. He sat my mother down, looked at her eye through a machine, told her not to move, and 15 seconds later was done. We came home and she waited for the extreme pain she had experienced with her other surgery. It never came. When she went home to the US she went to her eye dr and the dr told her the surgery had been done wonderfully. My mother asked why she had no pain and the dr told her they have new techniques and the best eye dr’s in the world in France. Oh and btw...the whole thing cost us €50!!
