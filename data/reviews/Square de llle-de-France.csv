ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwZ3VqM2dnRRAB,There is a small park here at the tip of the island. It a shame that the deportation memorial has now fenced off the ability to be at the point of the island. It must have been a great vantage point to take snapshots. There is a row of park benches underneath the trees. This makes for a good cooling off spot on a hot summer day.,5 years ago,2025-02-09 15:17:22.268295,5.0,Bruce Ferjulian,304,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117753377782118678247/reviews?hl=en-US

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrMnRYVTdnRRAB,"To get here, go to the back of the Notre Dame. Here you will see a long and tall hedge, its behind there. We left around 9 to the Notre Dame and found this place when looking for a place to have breakfast. I dont know if this is because of the whole Notre Dame being closed or not because of the fire, but there were barely any people. We had a nice and quiet breakfast with tons of shade because there were a lot of trees there. The view was also very nice because it is next to the river (the Seine). After this we went to the holocaust memorial next to it.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIX3EzRnNnRRAB,"This small square located on the banks of the Seine provides access to the martyrs' memorial. This eastern part of the Ile de la Cité was for a long time devoid of any particular use. Called “Motte aux papelards” or “Terrain” until the 18th century, this place seems to have been the repository of numerous rubble, after the construction of Notre-Dame Cathedral, and accumulated rubbish. In 1687, a first walled garden was noted as accessible only to cathedral canons and men. Then, Prefect Haussmann had the capital's morgue built there between 1861-1863 by the architect Émile Gilbert. The decision to move to Quai de la Râpée in 1914 allowed the creation, after destruction of the buildings, of a first square. It was in 1929 that it was baptized with its current name. The entrance to the Memorial of the Martyrs of Deportation takes place through the square. The construction of this monument-crypt from 1954 to 1964 by Georges-Henri Pingusson was an opportunity to rework the green spaces. A weeping willow is dedicated to the victims of Nazism and “Resurrection” rose bushes pay tribute to the Resistance and the victims of deportation.",4 months ago,2025-02-09 15:17:30.577421,4.0,Laurent Padou,851,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102878442016850755868/reviews?hl=en
