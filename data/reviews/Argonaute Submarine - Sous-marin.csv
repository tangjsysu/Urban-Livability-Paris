ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKbHRQc0RREAE,"Rude incompetant staff. We came a distance to see the submarine, asked at the information desk how to get a ticket for the submarine, he said to buy the ticket to the expositions, which we did at the automatic ticket dispenser. We walked through the dilapidated exposition centre all the way around to the submarine entrance. The rude woman there asked for our ticket, which I gave her. She said that the ticket didn't work there and motioned us away. I said (in french) that we had been told at the information desk that this ticket included the submarine. She said you need a reservation for the submarine. I had to ask how to do that. We had to go back to the entrance and line up for half an hour in a ticket line to get a 'creneau' and come all the way back. It took a hour before we could enter. It was interesting to see the int√©rieur of a real submarine, but it was not pleasant...tight and hot and needing to duck (I don't know how submariners do it). The tiny mus√©e part of the submarine exhibit has some interesting parts, but many of the exhibits weren't working.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBcGFXb0ZBEAE,"The Argonaute S636 is a Daphne-type submarine of the French Navy, which was commissioned in the 1960s. This submarine, whose main mission was underwater defense and coastal surveillance, is an example of naval engineering of the time. Although no longer in active service, it remains a symbol of the military innovation of its time. The S636 Argonaut is notable for its relatively small hull and ability to move quickly underwater. It was equipped with torpedoes and advanced navigation systems for its time, making it a key part of France's naval defense for several decades. Its design, while functional and efficient, was more compact compared to more modern submarines. However, a major drawback of this ship is that it was quickly overtaken by technological advances in submarine warfare. With the evolution of nuclear submarine capabilities and detection systems, the Argonaute S636 has become obsolete. It was decommissioned before becoming a museum ship, allowing visitors to discover its history and its role in the French navy. Despite its retirement from active service, the Argonaute remains a fascinating witness to naval history and an example of the submarine technology of its era.",a month ago,2025-03-15 22:47:40.926058,5.0,Tom Emma,380,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112881192911891167557/reviews?hl=en

Having already visited a submarine in our region (Espadon in St-Nazaire), this allows us to make a comparison. It‚Äôs worth visiting and having this type of machine open to all is fortunate. The visit to the submarine is quite quick. (-30min) Unfortunately, we feel pushed by the other visitors who follow us. Not necessarily time to see everything clearly. But the progress is well done. The exhibition is interesting, it even lasts longer than the visit to the submarine itself when you take the time. During this day, a former submariner was present to talk about his past, his knowledge and his anecdotes about this building that he knew.
