ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwdjl5QzR3RRAB,"This is the closest station to the Louvre Museum. You can enter the Carrousel gate relatively smoothly from here. But this year, I had to wait over 30 minutes for the security check. I feel like it's getting tougher every year. But if it's for counterterrorism purposes, it can't be helped. One more thing to note. This station has irregular checkpoints for unauthorized boarding. Maybe it's because there are a lot of passengers getting on and off. Two or three people are waiting at the exit. You will be asked to show me your ticket. Bali subway tickets are hard to read It is better to separate used items. Even if you pass through the ticket gate, it won't be collected at the exit station, so it's easy to be careless, but that's the source of mistakes! Many times I have encountered people who just jump over the ticket gate. That's why it is strictly checked. Once you pass it through the machine at the ticket gate, please keep it safe until you get off at the station. Otherwise, you may end up paying a fine. After learning about Navigo and using it three years ago, I said goodbye to that nervous excitement. If you are planning to stay in France for a week, we recommend Navigo.",5 years ago,2025-01-24 11:53:16.604448,4.0,すみれまりぴ,254,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100739868189169012658/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cE1YaDRnRRAB,"Magnificent metro station close to the Palais-Royal, the Comédie Française and the Louvre. The entrance to the Palais Royal - Musée du Louvre station, inaugurated in October 2000 and created under the direction of the artist Jean-Michel Othoniel, aroused as many comments as the creations of Hector Guimard in their time.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpbi03QmpnRRAB,"As soon as I arrived in Paris, a friend told me to be careful in the 12th arrondissement because of pickpockets. However, it happened quite quickly. I had just left the Palais-Royal metro when a guy bumped into me so that my cell phone fell to the ground; once inclined, a young American girl addressed me saying that my backpack was open, and lo and behold, I lost my passport as well as all my money. It was really terrible, and what's more I had to return to my country in 4 days; and then everyone could of course imagine the rest and all the difficulties I suffered to be able to return to Iran. So, be very careful of pickpockets and never carry your passport with you; All you need to do is have a copy on your smartphone.",4 years ago,2025-01-24 11:53:16.606444,4.0,Zeinab Golestani,26,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101999860606011573329/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cXBhTWhRRRAB,"Disgusting service, especially to tourists who don't speak French! To begin with, the subway does not have any signs for tourists that they must keep the subway ticket when taking it from the machine, so I threw it out just as heavy and when trying to leave this station a girl who does not speak Spanish or English that it is a universal language, it has detained me and my brothers, one of whom suffers from a reduced disability, it has not been detained illegally and because we did not have the tickets, they have made us pay a fine of 50 euros each, they did not bother to understand our situation that we are tourists and that we have paid like everyone else for the subway ticket and this girl has scammed us or BETTER SAID, YOU ARE TOURIST SCAMMERS.
