His enthusiasm and knowledge is infectious. I was traveling with a small stuffed animal from my son, and he helped me find some creative pictures of it touring the museum.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdUtpOEt3EAE,"This is one of the best and most unique museums I have visited in Paris . It is comprised of the best items from a private collection of phonographs and their precursors. Starting from an Edison tin foil(!) dictation machine and going forward to the 45 era and jukeboxes ( with maybe an 8 track or two), the museum has an incredibly thorough array of sound machines. They are beautiful to look at, but the truly captivating aspect is that they all work. And you will probably get close to a private tour from the owner/collector, Aro, who is an absolute font of information. Paris has so many great museums with works of great beauty, but most are static experiences. At this museum the works speak to you exactly in the way they did 100 years ago to those audiences. Do not miss this little museum.",2 years ago,2024-12-28 16:00:31.634021,5.0,james geagan,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112882724361059316427/reviews?hl=en-GB
