ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCN1p6VVR3EAE,"Rooms boasting with furniture and decorations belonging to Napoleon III, the nephew of Napoleon I. The luxurious apartments are found in the Richelieu wing of the Louvre museum.  The former emperor stayed in this apartment during his reign. Crystal chandeliers, gilded frame and walls covered completely make these rooms look quite exquisite in its French baroque style.  Napoleon I's throne is also on display in these apartments.  There were not that many people around in this part of the wing, so it allows for a quiet paced visit.",a year ago,2024-12-28 16:08:58.233988,5.0,Lucian Marin,448,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115456628886222260247/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6elBTZUR3EAE,"We specially arranged the itinerary of our European trip to see Napoleon's Apartments at the Louvre, which, according to its website were scheduled for reopening in May 2024.  As of the 31st May there has been no update about when they might reopen or even that it's been (obviously) delayed.  And it's been impossible to find relevant formation via any source. Questions to staff are meet with polite but apologetic shrugs. There is clearly a complete disconnect between the teams responsible for the Apartments' renovation and opening and those communicating to the public via staff or the Louvre's own websites as well as all the social media platforms on which the Louvre posts regularly.  Given the care we took to time our trip to see the Apartments, this has been a very frustrating and disappointing experience. We leave with a poor impression of the Louvre's management.",6 months ago,2024-12-28 16:08:58.233988,1.0,Ann Webber,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106373615321457690602/reviews?hl=en-GB
