Typically, large cities are twinned with several cities. New York, for example, has 13, including London, Madrid and Cairo. Unlike others, Paris is twinned only with the Italian capital. On January 30, 1956, the two cities united their destinies.  In 1959, Rome named a street in the Castro Pretorio district ""Via Parigi"". There is also a commemorative plaque and an ancient column topped by a bronze ship, the symbol of Paris. In the French capital, the symbol of Rome, a bronze she-wolf, was installed in 1962 in the heart of the Latin Quarter, opposite the Cluny Museum.",3 weeks ago,2025-01-24 11:32:48.406672,5.0,Sun Power,86,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108552564015995743065/reviews?hl=en-GB

The she-wolf, with its majestic and protective appearance, embodies the legend of the founding of Rome and the cultural legacy of the ancient Roman civilization. The Jardins des Tuileries provide a magnificent backdrop to admire this sculpture. The well-kept gardens, with their flower beds and winding paths, create an atmosphere of serenity and beauty.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndnBqQXhnRRAB,"It is a bronze reproduction of the Capitoline she-wolf located in Rome.  It was offered to the city of Paris by the city of Rome during their twinning agreement signed in 1956. This twinning agreement was developed after the Second World War to promote peace through institutionalized cultural and educational exchanges. The gift dates from 1962. These two cities are the rare ones to have only one twinning. The many other alliances with other cities are only pacts of friendship and cooperation.  We see the twins Romulus and Remus as children, fed by the Wolf. Indeed, Rome has nourished the world with its culture, which justifies the location of the statue in the heart of the Latin Quarter, near the only important monument of the Gallo-Roman era, the thermal baths of Cluny, opposite the Sorbonne.  Displayed for all to see, the symbol is ostentatious, the message is universal.  On the base, there is an inscription in Latin. This language was chosen because it was common to the two sister cities.
