ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYbmFlSlZnEAE,"I had the chance to visit the Greenhouses of the Luxembourg Gardens during the last Heritage Days on September 22th. Entrance was free and we enjoyed detailed explanations. However, I was not as impressed by the diversity nor the richness of the plants on display. The botanical gardens in other European capitals were much more impressive. In summary, if you are in the area and have time to spare, you may try to visit it, but I would recommend many other places in Paris that are much more worth a visit.",3 months ago,2025-01-24 12:16:54.583264,3.0,Dan Maarek,692,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101092586438291424548/reviews?hl=en-GB
