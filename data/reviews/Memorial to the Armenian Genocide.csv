ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2dFlYMjBBRRAB,"How is it possible that someone who is considered a ""victim of genocide"", while serving a prison sentence for his crimes, can be treated in a French hospital in Istanbul and then be allowed to go to France to recover!... For centuries, the Ottoman Empire treated the Armenians under its rule with the same justice as other peoples. However, during the First World War, the Ottoman Empire forced the deportation of a part of the Armenians because they were Ottoman citizens but had committed treason in favour of other states... Today, almost one hundred thousand Armenian citizens still live in the lands left by the Ottoman Empire, which is said to have committed genocide. But have you ever thought about how many Turks live in Armenia?",4 weeks ago,2025-01-24 12:08:15.736349,1.0,Yavuz Soysal,13,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118305117014670547329/reviews?hl=en-GB
