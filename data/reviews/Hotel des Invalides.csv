The whole place was built in 17 century by Louis XIV for the elderly, disable and homeless soldiers in his army. The  complex was magnificent especially knowing its history. It’s the only one serving this type of purpose in the world at the time. There are cannons displayed in the courtyard. Going into the complex is free. Only need to go through a security check. If want to see the museums, a ticket is required at the entrance. We used the museum pass to see the Museum of Army which was very impressive. I took one star off was because of the unclear instruction of the entrance. We were at the gate directly outside the Dome but the gate was closed. Without any notice or signage directing visitors to the correct entrance, we walked a large circle to its back to its side then finally found the entrance on the other side. When we finished visit and tried to go out, we were told the gate in front of the Dome would only open after 2pm.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2bU5hcWZ3EAE,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5/5  The Hôtel des Invalides in Paris is a must-visit for anyone who appreciates history, architecture, and French heritage. Originally commissioned by Louis XIV in 1671 as a hospital and retirement home for war veterans, the site has since evolved into a complex that houses museums, monuments, and the final resting place of Napoleon Bonaparte. My visit to this iconic landmark was truly unforgettable.  From the moment you arrive, you’re struck by the grandeur of the architecture. The vast courtyard, known as the Cour d’Honneur, is lined with symmetrical arcades and cannons, setting the tone for the military significance of the site. The highlight of the complex is undoubtedly the Dôme des Invalides, with its dazzling gold leaf dome that dominates the skyline. Standing beneath this dome and admiring its intricate frescoes and gilded details is breathtaking.  One of the most profound experiences here is visiting Napoleon’s tomb, housed beneath the dome. The tomb is made of red quartzite and rests on a green granite base, surrounded by twelve statues representing his military victories. The space is awe-inspiring and solemn, with intricate mosaics and inscriptions that pay tribute to Napoleon’s legacy. Whether or not you’re familiar with his history, standing in this magnificent mausoleum is a humbling experience.  The Musée de l’Armée (Army Museum) is another highlight of the Hôtel des Invalides. It boasts one of the most comprehensive collections of military artifacts in the world. The exhibits cover everything from medieval armor to World War II weaponry. The sections dedicated to the Napoleonic Wars are particularly engaging, featuring detailed displays of uniforms, weapons, and strategies that bring this pivotal era to life. The museum’s layout is informative and accessible, making it enjoyable for both history buffs and casual visitors.  In addition to the museum and Napoleon’s tomb, the Saint-Louis-des-Invalides Church is worth exploring. This serene and beautiful church, still serving veterans today, seamlessly blends with the larger complex. The church’s stunning stained glass and elegant design offer a peaceful retreat amid the historical grandeur.  The Charles de Gaulle Memorial adds a modern historical touch, with exhibits that explore his contributions to shaping 20th-century France. This thoughtful addition helps connect the site’s past with more recent history.  The Hôtel des Invalides is located in the 7th arrondissement, a short walk from the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River, making it an easy addition to your itinerary. I recommend dedicating 2-3 hours to fully experience everything. The staff are friendly, and guided tours are available for those wanting deeper insights. There is also a bookshop and café on-site for souvenirs or refreshments.  In summary, the Hôtel des Invalides offers a rich and immersive experience of French history, military heritage, and stunning architecture. Whether you’re captivated by Napoleon, fascinated by military history, or simply want to admire one of Paris’s most beautiful landmarks, this destination is well worth a visit.",2 months ago,2025-02-09 15:32:37.798007,5.0,KIANOL,39,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103721881522657186041/reviews?hl=en

The most impressive sight is the Dome Church, where Napoleon Bonaparte's tomb lies, surrounded by stunning architecture and intricate gold details.  I was surprised to learn that entry to the complex is free, which is amazing considering how much history you can explore within. The Musée de l'Armée, one of the largest military museums in the world, is located inside and offers fascinating exhibits ranging from medieval armor to World War II memorabilia. If you're a history buff, this place is a must-visit.  The grounds themselves are also beautiful, with manicured lawns and statues of famous French military leaders. Even if you're not into military history, the architecture and peaceful atmosphere make it worth the trip. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to explore, as there's so much to see.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3NnFXalV3EAE,"I've visited the Hôtel des Invalides a few times now, and each time it takes my breath away. The complex is steeped in history and magnificence, making it a place that always captivates me. There are two main entrances to explore: I recommend entering through the museum entrance, as it’s the most grand, taking you through the impressive courtyard first. However, the entrance near Napoleon's tomb is also great for those who want to capture a stunning photo from the outside.  You don't need to buy tickets ahead of time, but it's much more convenient, especially if you have a museum pass. The museum and Napoleon's tomb have separate entrances, so it doesn't matter which one you visit first. If you plan to explore the museum, be prepared for a thorough visit, as there's a lot to see. But if you're short on time, visiting Napoleon's tomb is perfect for a quick in-and-out experience. Make sure to go downstairs to get a closer view of the tomb and take some time to sit on the benches and admire the breathtaking murals on the ceiling.  Within the complex, there’s also a cafeteria where you can grab some drinks and food if you need a break.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfMmVta05nEAE,"At the Hôtel des Invalides, tourists can enjoy a remarkable free experience by visiting La Cour de l'Honneur, the main courtyard facing the Seine[5]. This impressive space showcases centuries-old canons and stunning architecture without any admission fee. Additionally, visitors can enter the Cathédrale Saint-Louis-des-Invalides at no cost, where they might be lucky enough to catch an impromptu organ concert[5]. These areas offer a glimpse into the historical and architectural grandeur of the complex, allowing tourists to appreciate its significance without spending a euro. The Hôtel des Invalides is an exceptional complex in Paris, both in size and historical significance. Its façade facing the Seine is an impressive 196 meters (643 feet) wide, making it one of the largest military structures in Europe[2]. The complex features fifteen courtyards, with the largest being the Cour d'Honneur, designed for military parades[7].  One of the most remarkable aspects of Les Invalides is its iconic golden dome, which stands 107 meters (351 feet) tall, making it the tallest church building in Paris[7][10]. This dome is decorated with 12.65 kilograms (27.9 pounds) of gold leaf, creating a stunning landmark visible from afar[10].  Historically, Les Invalides played a crucial role during the French Revolution. On July 14, 1789, Parisian rioters stormed the complex and seized cannons and muskets from its cellars, which were then used in the attack on the Bastille later that same day[7]. This event marked a significant moment in the beginning of the French Revolution.",3 weeks ago,2025-02-09 15:32:42.246447,4.0,George Benaroya,381,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102310139501387459611/reviews?hl=en
