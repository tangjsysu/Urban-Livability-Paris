ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaHZUU2VnEAE,"Delighted to have spent an hour with Proust, and thanks to V√©ronique Aubouy for her talent as a storyteller. For the first time in the small room of the Maison de la Po√©sie last night 02/10/2023, I still have a burning memory on my head this morning, following my fall while trying to leave my seat. When I arrived I told myself ‚Äúbe careful when leaving‚Äù, then carried away by the joy of the moment, I completely ignored this reminder. Installed at the back, in the last row on the right at the edge of the aisle, when leaving my seat I fell and my skull hit the ground violently where the person was who was announcing the remaining time. The seat is located approximately 80 cm from the ground, without support. I think this accident is bound to happen again, and installing a support, fixed to the floor or wall, is necessary. I could have broken my back, I was very lucky, just a head trauma without loss of consciousness. I would like to thank, very much, the two young people at the restaurant who kept me sitting at the bar for a good quarter of an hour with ice cubes on my head, before I could go home. I really appreciated this ""attempt to summarize La Recherche"", and I will return to the House of Poetry, but installed in another seat.
