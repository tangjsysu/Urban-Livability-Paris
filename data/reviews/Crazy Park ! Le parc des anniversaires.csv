ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQMm9TM0FREAE,"First time for me with my almost 3 year old daughter and it won't be the last. Super large park, top hygiene. Multitudes of play structures according to ages. electric karting for 1 euro. And there are several games and small rides for 2 euros in tokens per game. We went there on a Saturday morning at 11 a.m. and it was rather quiet with few people. We had our lunch at the park and it was really very good (chicken curry panini menu and dino children's menu) and Halal which is not insignificant. The prices are super attractive. There is also the possibility of skiing, snowboarding and tobogganing for 15 euros per session and also of doing crazy fly. My daughter had a blast and as a mom I also had a great time without needing to take Doliprane üòÇ.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIeU1tNHRnRRAB,"I only give 2 stars but only for the decor and space. Having gone there with my son, I was very disappointed with this park (my son too). Almost nothing worked! The worst thing is that the tokens purchased cannot be refunded, supposedly, knowing that there are only 3/4 games that worked. According to staff, maintenance has not been completed. The park was closed for 1 month and no maintenance was done for reopening? It's scandalous, I lost my money. As for the park itself, there are beautiful infrastructures, but dust everywhere! It's not maintained! Whatever we touch, we feel the dust in the touched and olfactory sense of the term. In 1 month of closure, the cleaning has not been done? Also impossible to help our son in the infrastructure because it is forbidden to go up there. This is not very cool knowing that it is also possible. For my part I do not recommend, you will lose your money. The window is beautiful, but it's not crazy in the background. Better to go next door to R. Kid.
