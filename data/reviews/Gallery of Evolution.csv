ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYNjZ5bXF3RRAB,"The Evolution Museum in Paris left a great impression on us! It’s huge, with interactive exhibits that even the kids enjoyed. The realistic models of animals and dinosaurs were especially impressive. However, we missed having more clear instructions and descriptions in English for some of the exhibits.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROcUtmUVlnEAE,"Let's be honest - it's a great museum, but, museums exist to communicate and when the museum only has French explanations for 99.99% of the collection it fails to do this.  Only 3.6% of the world speaks French, so for foreign visitors it is highly unlikely that they will be able process the provided information. At a minimum there should be English notes provided as this would cover many of the international visitors. There's no audio guide, no free WiFi, and inside it's ridiculously dark....so much so that even if you could read French you'd need to flash light to read the plaques.
