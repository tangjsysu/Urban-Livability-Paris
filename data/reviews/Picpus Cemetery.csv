ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyb2I3eWFREAE,"Spent almost an hour trying to get the exact location of the place - Google Maps was NO help at all, and there is NO signage to inform you that you're in the right place. Head for the big wooden double doors at 35 Rue de Picpus, look to your right to push the entry buzzer. When you hear the click, push the left-most door *hard* - it's extremely heavy. (I tried pushing the wrong side multiple times - I apologized to the concierge once I was inside.) Pay your two euros, then head back to the little chapel for a quick look before exiting and continuing further back. Head right to access the actual cemetery. I was inspired to visit because I live in Yorktown, and it was the bicentennial of Lafayette's farewell tour of the (bigger) United States of 1824. There are other significant graves here - the sixteen nuns who went one by one to the guillotine singing hymns, as well as from more recent conflicts. I was most touched by the plaque of the father and son killed in WWII. (Thankfully there are some lovely chickens wandering around that lightened the atmosphere somewhat.)

Because if you didn't already know, the Picpus cemetery was used throughout the Revolution to bury the corpses of the guillotine victims. The corpses were often thrown into the mass grave and this list pays tribute to them since it is improbable to identify one skeleton among many others...
