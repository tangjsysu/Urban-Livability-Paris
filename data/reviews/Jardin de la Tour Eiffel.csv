ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3eElXcXFnRRAB,"Gorgeous view, came on a Monday between 2pm-3pm just the 3 of us. Got a few shops in the middle of the tower that do pizzas, chips, refreshments. We wanted a slush whilst it was 37Â° and obviously its a sell out on a day like that, so wasn't able to grab one. No bother, there was still plenty of refreshments to grab.  Nice views of Paris, was definitely worth the experience! I'd recommend extra staff for the Cafe areas as we were lined up for 30 minutes with 2 people serving, but they were polite and friendly and overall the experience is something we all very much enjoyed and recommend ðŸ˜Š",4 months ago,2024-12-28 16:24:33.210259,4.0,Heather Pl,30,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100833804183962557745/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROemVYY0pREAE,"I had such a memorable time taking a sunset stroll through the Jardin de la Tour Eiffel. This hidden gem in the bustling streets of Paris offers a peaceful escape with its lush green grass, vibrant flowers, and towering trees. It's the perfect place for a picnic or a leisurely walk, and the Eiffel Tower in the distance adds a picture-perfect backdrop.  As the sun started to set, the garden transformed into a magical place. The beauty of the surroundings was simply undeniable, and it was a much-needed break from the busy city life. The view of the Eiffel Tower against the evening sky was absolutely breathtaking and added to the garden's charm.  But I must admit, the persistent street sellers slightly dampened the experience. Their constant display of souvenirs and trinkets, at times, felt intrusive and disrupted the peaceful atmosphere of the garden.  Nevertheless, there was still an undeniable sense of tranquility in the air. Maybe it was the natural beauty of the garden or the enchanting allure of Paris itself, but it truly provided a moment of serenity amidst the city's hustle and bustle.
