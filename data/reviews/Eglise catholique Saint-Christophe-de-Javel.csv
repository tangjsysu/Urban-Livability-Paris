We took  time out after mass to enjoy the beautiful architecture and amazing paintings along with the ornate statues.  Speechless.  We thoroughly enjoyed our  hour of prayer and would definitely recommend attending mass at St. Christophe's 100%.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuNDdMc0dBEAE,"Since the 15th century, the place called Javetz, located on the south bank of the Seine, owes its name to a sandy islet. In 1777, a factory produced Eau de Javel there to whiten fabrics. At the end of the 19th century, mechanical workshops were established there, producing locomotives, airplanes, and later, automobiles with Citroën.  After its attachment to Paris in 1863, a chapel was erected, replaced in 1920 by the Saint-Christophe church, dedicated to travelers. The architect Charles-Henri Besnard used innovative techniques for its construction, completed in 1933.  Architect Charles-Henri Besnard used an innovative technique to reduce the construction costs of the Saint-Christophe church. He prefabricated reinforced cement elements directly on site, using wooden or staff molds. This provided clean surfaces ready for decoration, simplifying the process and reducing expenses. This method of prefabricating components on site marked progress in construction techniques of the time, subsequently influencing civil architecture.  The church is decorated with frescoes and stained glass windows, testifying to the artistic expression and faith of the early 20th century.",4 months ago,2025-02-09 15:16:48.269426,5.0,Alexandre Voisin,108,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115014905762172609502/reviews?hl=en
