ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMjlid3dBRRAB,"This magnificent cemetery is very poorly maintained! A shame! The entire city of Paris has become the Court of Miracles! I'm not afraid to say that ""it was better before""! To return to the tomb of Charles Baudelaire, which attracts many tourists all year round, it is not easy to find. Madame Anne Hidalgo could perhaps have a guide to the tombs of famous people printed and made available to visitors at the entrance to the Cemetery!
