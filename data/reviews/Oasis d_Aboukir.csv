ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5bVBiNld3EAE,This was a great surprise in a little shopping street in the second arrondissement. A building wall completely covered in green foliage! I can only imagine the animal sounds and perhaps visitors into the house from the animals that live in the urban jungle. I imagine it also keeps the building very cool during those hot Paris summers!,3 years ago,2024-12-28 16:24:00.675066,5.0,Laurent Fox,103,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105509124472612602429/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaOE55V1pnEAE,"Oasis d'Aboukir is a unique urban oasis located in the heart of Paris, France. It is situated in the 2nd arrondissement, near the bustling Rue Montorgueil and the Palais Royal.  Oasis d'Aboukir was created in 2013 by the landscape architect, Patrick Blanc. The project aimed to transform a neglected and abandoned space into a lush green oasis, providing a serene and natural environment in the midst of the city.  The oasis is built on the walls of an old building, covering an area of about 325 square meters. It features a vertical garden consisting of over 7,600 plants from 237 different species. The plants are carefully selected to create a vibrant and diverse ecosystem, with various colors, textures, and scents.  The vertical garden of Oasis d'Aboukir acts as a living artwork, showcasing the beauty of nature in an urban setting. It not only provides an aesthetically pleasing environment but also contributes to improving air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.  Visitors can enjoy a peaceful stroll through the oasis, surrounded by a lush green canopy. Benches are provided for people to sit and relax, taking in the tranquil atmosphere. The sound of water flowing from a small fountain adds to the soothing ambiance of the space.  Oasis d'Aboukir serves as a reminder of the importance of integrating nature into urban landscapes. It demonstrates how even small pockets of greenery can have a positive impact on the well-being of city dwellers.  The oasis is open to the public and free to visit. It has become a popular spot for locals and tourists alike, seeking a moment of calm and respite from the busy streets of Paris. Whether you're a nature lover, a photography enthusiast, or simply in need of a peaceful escape, Oasis d'Aboukir is a hidden gem worth exploring.",a year ago,2024-12-28 16:24:00.675066,5.0,ChefLaurent DE,601,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108476250316059010534/reviews?hl=en-GB
