ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYbmVibERREAE,"Large cemetery of Colombes. Maintenance of the cemetery is carried out very unevenly, since some paths are regularly cleaned and others left abandoned. Some paths are only maintained by families Large concentration of tiger mosquitoes, with no action from the town hall (despite the free solutions offered by families). A situation which will not improve given the responses from the town hall.",2 months ago,2024-12-27 20:09:43.383195,1.0,Christophe Sanglier,160,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100048036044879737400/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzaElpR0N3EAE,On 31/10 the cemetery seemed abandoned. Tall grass leaves debris trash cans full. It is not exhaustive. A little respect for the services for those who live there and who don't complain or break things,a month ago,2024-12-27 20:09:43.383195,1.0,Christian Lasson,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116529127581757864476/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIbFB1c3hnRRAB,"Abandoned cemetery, tall and prickly grass surrounds the graves. Water supply very often out of service. When you move around and you can't even water the plants it's pathetic. Because who says no water on Saturday, says no water on Sunday... Working from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. I unfortunately only have weekends to go see my mom, I think I'm not the only one in this situation...",3 months ago,2024-12-27 20:09:43.384195,1.0,Cindy Patchez,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111519212936893151778/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4eHZUU3VRRRAB,"We lost my beloved sister at the age of 55. They took place entirely on January 15, 2020. We were very upset because her daughter was very unwell, we had to wait for the firefighters to take her to the hospital which delayed the ceremony.  The guard kicked us out with the loud bell before the ceremony was over. This is unacceptable and shameful.  It ended in a big argument... he doesn't inherit this place",4 years ago,2024-12-27 20:09:43.384195,1.0,Irene Fonseca,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108602369629964685104/reviews?hl=en-GB
