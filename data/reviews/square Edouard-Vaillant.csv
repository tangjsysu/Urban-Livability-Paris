We headed towards the older children's area. A slide from 2 years old and that's it. And right next to those for older children. Already in terms of equipment it is very poor. Let's move on, the pinnacle is reached when scooters are running at full speed in the play area, making it dangerous for those who are on their feet and playing and running. And the parents find it normal and no guardians on duty. The 1-year-old obviously couldn't be put on the ground and went out in a stroller. So no, I won't praise it as the neighborhood park. Or go there before 4 p.m., not on Wednesdays, and maybe your young children will be quiet there.
