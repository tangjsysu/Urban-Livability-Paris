ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiaXBpQkJBEAE,"This is a review of their ""workshop""  It feels more like a way to sell their products than an actual workshop. They could allow users to actually do their own perfume rather than just provide three ingredients that visitors are provided and then are supposed to mix. The potential is huge and if they cared about visitors this could easily be a 5 star experience. They could keep this as a free PR version, and then add one where people could pay for the amount of ingredients they want to use and chose if they want to have a professional person who have knowledge in the area, or a sales person who is just there to sell their products.
