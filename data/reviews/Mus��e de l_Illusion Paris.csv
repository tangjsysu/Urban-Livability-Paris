ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIeTV2Y3ZnRRAB,"I recently visited the Musée de Illusions Paris Roissy, and it was an awesome experience! It’s only been 2 days since I arrived in Paris from Pakistan, and this was one of the highlights of my trip so far. The illusions were mind-blowing, and I loved how interactive and fun the exhibits were. As a student, I got a half-priced ticket, which made the experience even better. The museum is definitely worth a visit for anyone looking for something unique and entertaining. The staff were friendly and the whole place was well-organized. A great way to spend a few hours in Paris.",3 months ago,2024-12-28 16:07:53.971574,3.0,Murad Ahmad Shah,154,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117226933859129751671/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURicUxyR1NREAE,"Good spot for kids in the middle of a busy area. It is pretty small and should only take you about 30-45 minutes depending on how much time you spend at each exhibit. For the amount of time you spend here it is a bit pricey, but if you are desperate for something to entertain kids uninterested in the allure of Paris it is worth the stop.",4 months ago,2024-12-28 16:07:53.971574,4.0,anthony scott,195,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107310126350975670005/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzek5McHBBRRAB,It was a little short and crowded for a holiday weekend but that was to be expected. My 4 yo loved the illusions regardless. The nice man who checked us in also got us in quicker than originally expected so that was a kind gesture as well.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURidTZXTGxRRRAB,"I took my 9 year old son here and we both enjoyed it. The staff were friendly and helpful. The installations themselves were interesting and well put together. I'd advise you to take your time on each one as the museum is small. 1.5 hours is more than enough time to do this. We loved walking through the vortex tunnel and the chair and upside down illusions were fun to do. It's a shame the chair one isn't in a separate room as there were loads of people in the background of our photos.  The installations were classic ones and I gave 4 stars as I think that adding some more of the latest style illusions would really add something extra to the experience.  The location was great too as it was a short walk to restaurants, shops.",4 months ago,2024-12-28 16:07:53.973575,4.0,Liz Gaillard,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100752832685720699691/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNab1pIQ1pBEAE,"In my opinion, it's not worth the expense. The attraction tends to be quite crowded, often requiring waiting in lines for a glimpse or a photo. It would greatly improve with fewer visitors per time slot or better organization to alleviate congestion. Half the time, frustration set in due to the long waits and others vying for views simultaneously. Some exhibits require time to read and appreciate. Even my 10-year-old found the arrangement dissatisfying. I wouldn't spend money on it, knowing what to expect. Booking in advance is essential to bypass the outdoor wait.",a year ago,2024-12-28 16:07:53.974575,2.0,Ir Ke (Nickname),506,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114417820687827992997/reviews?hl=en
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2aU4ycXNBRRAB,A good hour to spend laughing and discovering optic illusions.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3ajktZ0JBEAE,I do not recommend. It is too small. 1.75 floors. We asked at reception was there more. Exhibits are basic and well known. 3 good items Perspective bench. Upside down. Vertigo tunnel and mirror room. Needs 20 more items like them. Very unimpressed. Finished in 25 mins. For €19. Way overpriced. That is €45 an hour. Poor value.
