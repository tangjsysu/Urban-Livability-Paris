ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWNF95ZEtREAE,"Very beautiful station, one of the most beautiful in France, with its clock tower and its wings decorated with crests. The current station was built for the Universal Exhibition of 1900. It is the work of the architect Toudoire. Inside there is a fresco by the painter Jean-Baptiste Olive.
