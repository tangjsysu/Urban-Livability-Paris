ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRZ3EyZ2x3RRAB,"Historically this place was part of the property of the Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau family who had owned an estate of around fifty hectares on the hill since 1695. The place was used for optical telegraph experiments by Claude Chappe from 1790 to 1798, as evidenced by the plaque to the right of the main entrance, as the cemetery is at the highest point in Paris at 128.508 m. After various stages of division and sale of the property, a cemetery was finally inaugurated in 1804 to cope with the saturation of those of the old Saint-Jean-Baptiste church in Belleville. Initially the communal cemetery of the village of Belleville, the cemetery was attached to the city of Paris during the annexation of the territory of Belleville in 1860.  Resting there, among other well-known figures, is Léon Gaumont, pioneer of the cinema industry.
