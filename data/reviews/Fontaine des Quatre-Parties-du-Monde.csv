ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQemE2S2pnRRAB,"This is the fountain monument situated at the southern end of the Garden of the Grand Explorers. It was designed by Gabriel Davioud and features striking sculptural work by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and colleagues. The fountain was unveiled in 1874.  What you see is a bronze sphere being held by four females representing (Europe, Asia, Africa and America). They each twist and contort themselves while holding the sphere upward. From below horses rise from the basin. Water spouts from dolphins and turtles evenly spaced within the basin.
