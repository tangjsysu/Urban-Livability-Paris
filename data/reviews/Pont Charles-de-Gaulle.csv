ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnbF96VFpnEAE,"Despite this bridge not being as famous as some of the others, this bridge still gives some beautiful panoramic views of the city of Paris along the Seine and still offers a really nice walk. It‚Äôs open all the time and is really beautiful at any time of the day, especially during sunrise or sunset when the sun reflects against the Paris skyline or at night when the skyline is all lit up. Since it‚Äôs close to many of the attractions of the city, it‚Äôs a great location for those wanting to spend time in the city. And since it‚Äôs not as popular as the other bridges, it is not that packed with tourists, making it more enjoyable of a stroll to some. The architectural work of the bridge is also absolutely stunning, and is a great opportunity for photos.",6 years ago,2024-12-28 15:24:51.806384,5.0,Ayla Kim,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117023757511887065724/reviews?hl=en-GB

However, the bridge requires renovation and the cleanliness leaves something to be desired because the closed trash cans have been sealed (probably for the vigipirate plan). Substitute bins have certainly been put in place, but there are too few of them and their position gives the impression of a sloppy arrangement. The surroundings of the bridge lack careful and coherent landscaping, shade, and greenery. The access to the quays of the Seine are poorly indicated and lack maintenance (not to mention the smell of urine at the stairs leading to the quays of the Seine).
