ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMTZUd05nEAE,"This square located at the corner of rue de la Roquette and Passage Charles Dallery is a very interesting place.  A chance to discover a book by Franz Olivier Giesbert entitled ""The end of an era"" which I really liked.  This book taught me that you should never let the pig and the fox form an alliance, otherwise they would end up eating the whole farm.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in farm stories.
