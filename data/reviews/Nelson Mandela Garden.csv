ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwNnR5aXZnRRAB,"The photos for this garden look lovely. But in reality it is a sad, smelly, run down park. The more impressive climbing frames are only for kids 7-12 (age enforced by park wardens), with a separate space for 2-6 year olds (with many kids over this age, ironically). The 2-6 park is run down, poorly maintained equipment, filthy and squalid toilet (poo smeared against the stalls in two stalls, sewage overflowing in the other). Park wardens smoking and not cleaning. The wider area is quite scary with the smells of urine and weed, lots of beggars and crowds.  Definitely not worth the trip.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwcHQ2LTVBRRAB,"This is the space which used to be the market square of old Paris, hence the name 'les halles' which refers to the market halls. From here fresh produce was brought to the neighboring streets, which gave life to the restaurants, cafes and shops at the famous cobblestone-covered Rue Montorgueil nearby. The area was in a state of disrepair until recently, when it was renovated - now there is a multi-storey shopping mall here with all the usual stores inside, and outside a nice, airy park with some modern features. There are playgrounds that are popular with local kids. The church of St Eustace is worth checking out, which has been a notable feature of the site for centuries.
