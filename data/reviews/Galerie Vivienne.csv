ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYaEtPcHZ3RRAB,"While you could describe Galerie Vivienne as a mall, the term would falsely evoke for Americans those structures which housed the Nordstroms, Sees and Barnes & Nobles of our bygone childhoods.  On the other hand a 200 year old covered passageway like Galerie Vivienne adorned with ornate iron roof and decor is something different.  It is an opportunity to stroll through shops, while imagining what old Paris was like when wealthy ladies would stroll through the passageways with their enormous bustled dresses, and they had husbands or lady servants who carry their parcels for them .",2 months ago,2024-12-28 15:06:58.584221,5.0,P W,276,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106142468026787183516/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2OE5yeVV3EAE,"On 5 Rue de la Banque, 75002, lies one of the most elegant covered passages in Paris. The covered passages and galleries of Paris are home to antique store, tearooms restaurants, coffee shops, bookstores with old books, theatres and even small museums and boutique hotels entrances. Most were built in the 19th century. These galleries are often difficult to find, because piercing the middle of the buildings, not being specially signaled, they can go unnoticed. So, make your searches before the stroll, or choose to join a guided tour that offers passages. Surmounted by glass roofs to be enlightened, they have become a typical Parisian curiosity and tourist attraction. Don't miss them if you're in Paris❗ There are about twenty of them, located around the Haussmannian ""Grand Boulevards"", but you don't have to see them all. Visit a couple of them, which are the most interesting, should be enough. Start with the famous *Galerie Vivienne (just behind the Palais-Royal former Palais Cardinal), then the nearby *Colbert gallery with no shops, but a good and elegant brasserie, 'Grand Colbert'. Gallery Colbert is known for its colonnade and its Art Deco style. Then continue with: *Panorama passage with its theater ""des Variétés"" (dates from the dawn of the 19th century, 1799), *Brady Passage (also called ""Little India"") known for Indian and Pakistani restaurants, then *Jouffroy Passage (a quite unique passage, with its Grévin wax figures Museum, the Hotel Chopin and not to be missed Valentin teahouse. Other passages worth a stroll are: *Verdeau (known for its antique shops), *Cairo (known for garments and fabrics) and *Passage du Grand-Cerf.
