ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcmRtdEx3EAE,"I was in a nearby shopping centre and I was walking down the street and looking at the shop windows, when I suddenly saw a corridor and at the end of it something that looked like a church. I came to take a look because I was curious about what this church looked like from the inside. By pure chance, service started a minute after that, so I sat down and enjoyed the one-hour service in French. I didn't understand anything, but after a while I found out that they were saying exactly the same thing as at my home country. Same sequence, same tones. For the first time, I saw people sitting around the altar in the church. I then asked people and they said that this is a special church. There is usually an altar at the end and you sit in front of it. If you are a believer and you happen to be passing by, go take a look.
