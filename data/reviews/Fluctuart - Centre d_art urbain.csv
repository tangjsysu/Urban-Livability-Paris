ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6bDlyRDhBRRAB,"The idea is great. But they don't allow people to visit the terrace unless they have a specific type of reservation or VIP code that we never understood how to get. We assume they do some kind of profiling to allow access. We had a qr code from an app that granted access to the venue during a party that was supposed to start from 19:00 but they didn't let us in before 21:30 and never to the terrace. The gallery was closed. The floating building flushes to the river, polluting the water. Its impact is huge as the floating cushions placed to absorb pollutants show. The place is overrated, it is not inclusive and they should seriously revise their access policies. Staying in the terrace is ok for everyone, but access to the floating premises is based on hidden codes that establish hierarchies and that is social exclusion, period.",9 months ago,2025-03-15 22:20:50.118786,1.0,Alejandra Bernal,137,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109694236039062454194/reviews?hl=en
