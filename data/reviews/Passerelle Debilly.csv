ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSbElpWFFnEAE,"Oh Man, the only word I could say is awesome. The bridge at night is super heart warming. I cant explain how good it felt to feel the water in dim lights. The warm lights over the bridge were dreamy. Apart from that you can find few people selling Crepes, Souvenirs, Keychains and power banks at cheap prices.  Moreover, you can find alot of photographers at the bridge, some are paid and some do for the love of photos and smiles. I was one of the photographers to spread love and do it at a cost of a smile. Over all, do visit this place. The most interesting part was the locks of love with names and dates all over the bridge. So if you are visiting with a loved one dont forget to buy the lock and place it on the bridge as a memory.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVeU9maVd3EAE,"Now classified as one of the historical monuments in Paris, the Passerelle Debilly is a cycle and foot bridge over the River Seine that was constructed in 1900 for the World Fair and became a permanent bridge after it was relocated slightly to its current position. When plans were being put in place for the 1900 World Fair in Paris, it was decided that a temporary bridge needed to be erected in order to accommodate people wishing to go from one part of the exhibition on the left bank of the River Seine over to other exhibits on the right bank. So it was decided that a metal pedestrian bridge would be erected and demolished a few years later, just like the Eiffel Tower was supposed to have been demolished after 20 years from its inauguration at the 1889 World Fair. It was then designed by the engineers Lion, Amedee Alby and Jean Resal, who was also instrumental in the design of the impressive Alexandre III bridge in Paris, and the construction of the bridge was first approved in the October of 1898. The bridge was completed in the April of 1900 and had been referred to by different names such as the Magdeberg or the de Billy footbridge, and when the City of Paris took over the management of the structure, they had the position of it moved in 1906 to its current location.",5 years ago,2025-01-24 14:00:28.603847,5.0,nima farhadi,134,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117372309136404045915/reviews?hl=en
