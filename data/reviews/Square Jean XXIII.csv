ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3b3FlVU1REAE,Notre Dame and its grounds are one of the most popular places for visitors to Paris.  The cathedral is situated on the bank of  river Seine.  Lots of people were walking and enjoying the grounds. There was a musician entertaining people  The line up to enter the cathedral was short at the time and we went in.  The admission was free.  The experience was amazing.  There is a display describing the history of the building of this huge cathedral which took over 100 years to build. This was very informative and interesting.  There is a small gift shop inside the cathedral.,6 years ago,2024-12-28 17:12:12.085879,5.0,Subrata Chakrabarti,987,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104279926668945731947/reviews?hl=en-GB
