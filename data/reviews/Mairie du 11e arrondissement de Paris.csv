The zone was only 50% full with more than 3x the number of people watching from in between the large surrounding prison walls and the foliage outside. Even worse, as people left the zone, they did not let anyone else in, so the zone slowly became almost empty whilst lots of people were outside the zone and could have enjoyed unobstructed views inside. Additionally, the screen placement was horrendous and it did not need any obstructing graphics around it. Awful atmosphere and showing of the Olympics. One young girl even tried to sneak in to the emptying zone and was removed by 4 guards/police. Crazy. Zero management or care for the people‚Äôs enjoyment.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbDlyMWhRRRAB,"A very lively neighborhood. Used to be the home of artisans and craftsmen, but those days are mostly gone with gentrification and the old workshops have been transformed into upscale apartments. The neighborhood is also full of young people, especially in the evening when the cafes are packed. Great place for long walks. The 11th arrondissement is not ""touristy"", like some central districts. But, there is a very particular atmosphere here, which is due to the population of the neighborhoods. This district is not the most populated (155,000 inhabitants), but the densest in population. Mostly young, dynamic and trendy, in certain neighborhoods, such as along Boulevard Voltaire, with the streets from North to South: Oberkampf, de la Roquette, and de Charonne. Likewise, the district is framed by three prestigious squares, to the North ""La R√©publique"", to the South East ""La Nation"" and to the South West ""La Bastille"". Around the Bastille, many bars, restaurants and nightclubs offer nighttime activities. During the day, the area is lively with many restaurants, notably Rues du Faubourg Saint Antoine and de La Roquette;  To the north, rue du Faubourg Saint Martin, offers popular bars, restaurants and concert halls. For those who want to have a good evening, the 11th arrondissement offers plenty of choice. In these neighborhoods, nightclubs or cabarets, ""trendy"" bars, offer themed evenings, including: Gibus 18 rue du Faubourg du Temple (dico, funk, house music), Cith√©a Nova at 112 rue Oberkampf , is an underground concert hall, popular with young people. Rue de Lapp, where there are clubs and bars galore, the Chapelle des Lombards is an institution in the ""Tropical"" style as well as the famous ""Bal √† Jo"". The Palais des Glaces at No. 37 rue du Faubourg Saint Marin is a One Man show venue, where all the well-known artists perform. The Bataclan, located at 50 boulevard Voltaire, is an establishment in the style of a Chinese Pagoda. After the massacre of November 13, 2015, it got a makeover with a brewery and resumed its concert activities. Finally, the Cirque d'Hiver, at No. 110 rue Amelot, near the ""Filles du Calvaire"" metro station, offers the Bouglione circus and also variety shows.  the 11th arrondissement also has lively areas during the day, around the three squares, but also in the neighborhoods, with shops of all categories, restaurants, and squares and gardens for taking a break. The squares are spread throughout the district, including that of La Roquette, at number 143 of the street, with pleasant and diverse spaces. That of Emile Gall√©, is a little gem of romanticism, south of rue de Charonne, at 39 rue Neuve des Boulets, Finally, all along the boulevard Jules ferry in the north to the Bastille in the south with Boulevard Richard Lenoir, the city of Paris, has organized very diverse green spaces on the central plain. There are shades, plantations, relaxation areas and water jets. Street markets are also held on all major thoroughfares, particularly on Sunday mornings on Boulevard Richard Lenoir.

To make it short, my partner was born in France but of Portuguese nationality. French law stipulates that, to enter into a civil partnership, only a French birth certificate is necessary for a person in this situation. French civil status takes precedence over Portuguese nationality. But obviously, the town hall of the 11th, in addition to not mastering the laws in force, believes itself to be above them! My file was refused because apparently I ""did not read the notice correctly"" (note which does not mention any information on this ""particular situation""). It was then explained to me that it was imperative to request from the Portuguese consulate a certificate of non-pacs and a customary certificate for my partner, otherwise it would be impossible to enter into a civil partnership. I took the liberty of pointing out to them that this is not what the government and the public service indicate (supporting evidence). I was therefore condescendingly told that ""it is not because you are born in France that you are French.
