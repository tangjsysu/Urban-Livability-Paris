ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2OExibHB3RRAB,"A cute small museum that is an important part of history, admission is free and information is displayed in both French and English. It's worth noting that her labs were decontaminated in the early 1980's and is perfectly safe to see/visit. I brought a gamma scintillator for fun and readings were not above background levels.

It was a wonderful experience learning about the journey of Radioactivity right from Radium discovery, advantages, controversies and practical application by Pierre Curie and his wife Marie Curie. The main room exhibits the entire journey with scientific instruments and research done on radiation and its use in cancer treatment. There is a theory room: Marie Curie office and a practical room: Marie Curie laboratory. The entire journey of Curie family with 5 Nobel Prizes: Marie Curie, her husband Pierre Curie, their daughter Irene Curie and son-in-law Jean Frederic Joliot is very inspiring. A very special thanks to the Curie family for their contributions and the team managing this place. Don't forget to visit the small garden in the backyard.

You can see the actual working place (lab) and office of Marie Curie and learn about the Curie family's work and history with many fun facts. The hologram display with comics was a nice touch as well.  It was an honour to be here visiting the working place of several great scientists who sacrificed their lives for advancement in the science of radioactivity.

Although the museum is small it was perfect for her. She was overwhelmed to see Marie's real life laboratory and office and all the equipment that she used. A lovely lady from the desk came over to explain some information. But she ended up getting schooled by our daughter. At which point the lovely lady said she knew enough and could get a job in the museum. After purchasing some items from the shop the lady gave our daughter a photo of Marie and it was signed, explaing it is only for VIP guests. It will be very hard to ever top this experience.

There is an interactive timeline where you can learn about her life, her husband's and children's, which was pretty neat.
