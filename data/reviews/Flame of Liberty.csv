ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNzhhODVBRRAB,"The Flame of Liberty is a little-known but unique attraction in Paris that visitors might enjoy. Located at the northern end of the Pont de l'Alma bridge, the Flame of Liberty is a replica of the torch from the Statue of Liberty in New York City. Here are some little-known special attractions about the Flame of Liberty: The flame has become a symbol of Franco-American friendship since it was gifted to France in 1987 by the International Herald Tribune, a newspaper based in Paris with strong ties to the United States. The Flame of Liberty became an impromptu memorial site for Princess Diana after her tragic death in 1997. The flame is located just above the entrance to the tunnel where the accident occurred, and people continue to leave flowers and notes in tribute to her. The flame has been used as a backdrop for several high-profile events and photoshoots, including fashion campaigns for Dior and Louis Vuitton, and music videos for Beyonc√© and Jay-Z. Visitors can climb a nearby staircase to get a closer view of the flame, as well as stunning views of the Seine River and the Eiffel Tower. The Flame of Liberty is located in a quiet and peaceful area of Paris, away from the crowds of more popular attractions.
