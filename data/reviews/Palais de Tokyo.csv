Free tampons are really nice but this doesn‚Äôt annihilate the need for basic things to attend to bleeding. You stage expositions for and of trans and gender queer people and are obviously sensitive to the needs of underrepresented groups, so please take care of menstruation women, too. Anyway, the possibility of personal Hygiene also applies to any other group of people. Thanks.
