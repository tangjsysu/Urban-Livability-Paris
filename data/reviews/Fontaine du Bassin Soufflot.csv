ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzd1pudm5RRRAB,"This is a fountain just outside the eastern end of the Luxembourg Garden situated in a small traffic island along Blvd Saint-Michel. It is the work of Gabriel Davioud (1862) and embellished with the sculpture centrepiece by Gustave Crauk (1884).  What you see is a triton and nereid holding up a large conch shell from which water spouts upwards, spilling into the ground level basin which is surrounded by plants and an iron fence. It is a decent fountain monument even if a little bit difficult to view up close because of the fairly steady stream of motor traffic.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 11:45:41.885861,3.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwbE9XRk5REAE,"Built by the architect Gabriel Davioud in 1862, during the reign of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, the fountain of the Soufflot basin is located where the current Place Edmond Rostand is located at the foot of Rue Soufflot.  It was only 20 years later that the pool was decorated with the bronze sculpture made by Gustave Adolphe Désiré Crauk. Water gushes from a large shell erected by a triton and a nereid.  The fountain gives a perspective view of the Pantheon which is worth getting closer to take incredible photos.",a year ago,2025-01-24 11:45:41.888862,5.0,Prométhée Spathis,74,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113562946548709790447/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2NklyQXRnRRAB,"Very beautiful fountain which overlooks the Luxembourg Gardens on one side and the other side faces Rue Soufflot and in the distance the Panthéon... The fountain of the Soufflot basin, also called the Pastoral Basin, is located on Place Edmond Rostand (named after the famous writer and author of Cyrano de BErgerac...)... a short distance from the metro exit: Luxembourg... The bronze sculpture which adorns the basin was created in 1862 by Gustave Adolphe Désiré Crauk and represents a triton and a nereid holding a large shell... Very beautiful and very aesthetic, especially in sunny weather where its water drops shine in the sun and seem to twirl like silver flakes.... The Pantheon in the distant background is an opportunity for very aesthetic photos as I think I will show in my photos which I am attaching on Google Maps.",3 years ago,2025-01-24 11:45:41.890864,5.0,Fred Booker,495,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115485660678768601234/reviews?hl=en
