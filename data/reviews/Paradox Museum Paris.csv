ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2eV9XYnpBRRAB,It was an amazing experience to be there at paradox museum. It is a must visit place for parents with their children. It is educative and entertaining at the same time. The only thing that I noticed was there were way less number of employees for clicking pictures and for suggesting what exactly the paradox is in some of the frames. Otherwise the experience was good. More number of people might have more fun.,4 days ago,2024-12-28 16:05:15.050265,4.0,Muskan Garg,80,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116535395202703470694/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzanZ5ZEZnEAE,Fun experience for the whole family.  Great activity on a rainy day.   Suggest buying tickets in advance.  Family discount available mid-day.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzNGNqLVpREAE,"It was a good and fun experience. You have to go definitely with some friends to make it more fun. I don't think you can have enough fun alone. We were 2 and sometimes for some of the rooms, there was no one so we asked other people to take our picture and they were nice enough to accept to take it but not the best one with the camera. And it's not easy to ask them to take more because they failed :)  Since you are waiting a lot in some of the rooms, it can kill the mood (we went there on Sunday). There isn't a structure to wait on the queue, so sometimes you realize that some people are just passing you while waiting. I need to admit, it was still a bit pricey.  Overall, if you have 1 hour to spend with some friends and you like taking funny photos, give it a shot.",a month ago,2024-12-28 16:05:15.055265,4.0,İlkem Erul,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109330599788980503426/reviews?hl=en

Lots of great exhibits to play with, take funny photos with your family etc.  Unfortunately the owners are clearly too greedy and let too many people in at the same time meaning there are crazy queues at each point.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxaVB5VzNRRRAB,"This museum was so much fun for us: hubby, me and our 24 year old. I think it's fun for any age. Don't assume it's just for kids. We laughed and learned and had a great time exploring.  The science of each exhibit makes the museum more interesting. Be ready to read signs explaining how to best interact and what scientific theory is at work. This place was created to make memories! Be ready to take lots of pics and vids. Don't be afraid to be creative and silly with pics. The staff, in their black and white ""scan code"" jumpsuits, is super helpful. We especially appreciated Raphaël's help in the kaleidoscope room and at the dinner table. He clearly enjoys his job helping people and explaining things.  He took photos for us and helped us get the most out of our visit.  Other staff were great too. When you buy your online tickets, I recommend paying close attention to when the time slots are busiest. Plan your visit to catch the slots that have lots of available tickets so it won't feel so crowded.  We bought our tickets for 1:30 with the next a couple of hours of slots sold out. Our visit was crowded and we did wait at most stops and skipped a couple because of lines.  I think for the day we went, a morning visit might have been less crowded. Bottom line? So worth the time and price of admission.
