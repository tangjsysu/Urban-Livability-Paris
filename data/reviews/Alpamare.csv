ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2dWVmNW9RRRAB,"I don't understand the bad reviews, this waterpark is amazing and it's by far my favorite in Switzerland!!! The slides are some of the best in Europe in my opinion, and it's definitely my favorite collection on this continent even after being to dozens of other waterparks. The park is also very well maintained and clean, this was definitely an issue in the past that I noticed since I've gone here very often, but it has been beautifully fixed.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURibDlpWjlRRRAB,After reading some negative reviews we didn‚Äôt know what to expect- but we had the best afternoon! Such a nice mix of sides and something there for everyone. My kids are 16 and 10 and loved all that was on offer. The car parks were full(not a problem for us as we came by public transport) but the queues were minimal for the slides and it didn‚Äôt feel overcrowded. We bought the 4 hour ticket which was ample. Yes the tickets are pricey but I‚Äôd say great value for money when there is so much on offer. We bought the tickets with SBB and basically got our transport free. Loved the outdoor pools and enjoyed the amazing views across the lake. The pools were well maintained and clean and I really enjoyed the salt water pool.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybk5yNVFREAE,Had a great time  Got in after 6 PM and only paid 33.- CHF and a extra 6.- Francs for the wellness area.  3 or 4 saunas and there are special saunas with ‚ÄûAufguss‚Äú.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3alBxZGFBEAE,"Nice evening visit, though the 46chf for a 4h ticket is crazy. ‚Ä¢Arriving: Bought a 4h ticket in the afternoon (sunday). The parking lot is a bit hidden, due to a construction work. It is expensive but at least the car park was free. Was not too busy and the slides had only a max. of 5min waits. Inside it looks pretty clean and you see that the facilities and changing rooms have all been renovated. ‚Ä¢Slides: The water slides are of course Alpamare's strongest. They got a nice variety of slides. Notable favorites are Cresta Canyon (very fast tire slide), Jungle Run (fun and fast double racing body slide), Tornado (funnel slide) and Blizzard (fast body slide). Mini canyon was also pretty fun. Cobra is fun as well but you get thrown around a lot. The cone slide is ok but you often stall in the cones and the lazy river slide seems like a design fail since you always get stuck. ‚Ä¢Pools: The wave pool is pretty fun, has large waves. I enjoyed the 36¬∞C salt water pool with its whirlpools its perfect to relax. The pool with the water current is also fun but tends to be very crowded.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbzlmTXBnRRAB,"I was there a couple of times and most of the times it was a pleasant experience. My last visit during a weekday, however, was less than perfect: The entire pool and slides area was very cold (apparently there was no heating). This is especially unpleasant if you have to wait in line at the water slides. In addition, at least 2 slides were closed but I wasn't informed about this when I paid for the tickets. In addition, there should have been a small price reduction if not all slides are open. The whole facility seems older and not well maintained. You can for example observe some pool mosaic tiles that have fallen out if you are at the outside pool areas. Inside, at the walls next to some slides you can see mold. It seems the owner has no interest in investing money in the proper maintenance of the facility. The restaurant is very small and very busy at lunch time with long waitign queues and usually no place to sit during rush hour. The food itself is rather of poor quality and expensive.  The slides themselves are fun, but the Cobra slide is probably a bit too much, at least for me: I get hurt every time I use it despite following all rules. My son hit his right ellbow in the jungle run slides and had a small wound with blood coming out (nothing serious but an indication that this slide can be dangerous as well!).",8 months ago,2024-12-27 19:43:03.798201,3.0,Manuel B,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102635146358448091921/reviews?hl=en

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5ajZfTGd3RRAB,"We took our toddler who loves slides because he usually cannot use the slides in europe due to age and/or size restrictions. He also absolutely loves water :)  The slides you can have with small kids are nicely described (you see two people sliding or it says the parent has to lie but the kid can sit). However the toddler area totally needs investment. Currently in aquaparks the toddler areas have soft and grippy floor (a bit similar as on playground) on the whole space, EVERYWHERE! Here however there are only rubber mats on the pathways and most of the floor is a slippery toddler danger. There are cool toddler devices but if your baby wants to have fun they will end up slipping and hurting themselves. The same with the toddler pool, the sides of it are plastic and a huge danger for the babies. Moreover some sprinkle devices inside the todller pool have probably seen their better times and will never be fixed (i.e. the turtle). This cannot be because toddlers do not follow the path but want to run around, and this is supposed to be a place for them.  I also tried the slides without the toddler, and I must say, they are tiptop, the most difficult cobra and the jungle run gave me enough grown up thrill to be really happy :)",9 months ago,2024-12-27 19:43:08.148790,3.0,Micha≈Ç Osiecki,57,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113350889152711742364/reviews?hl=en

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwM05qOV9BRRAB,"I visited a water park today with my two friends, and overall, we had a great time enjoying the slides. However, I feel compelled to mention that some of the toboggans labeled as ""red"" for difficulty seemed extremely dangerous. During our ride, we unexpectedly gained excessive speed and were thrown out of the tube, hitting our heads quite hard. It was alarming to experience a momentary white flash upon impact. Personally, I also injured my arm, and even hours later, it still hurts. I believe such situations can be very hazardous and may lead to severe injuries, possibly even lifelong consequences. It is my hope that the Alpamare team addresses and resolves this issue promptly to ensure the safety of all visitors.  In addition to the concerns about the dangerous toboggans, I must also mention that the food at the water park was disappointing. The quality was subpar, and the prices were excessively high. For instance, a small cheeseburger costing 15 CHF was simply unreasonable and felt like an act of greed on their part.
