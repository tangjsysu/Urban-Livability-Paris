ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNOTZ1N013EAE,"It is the church of my childhood and youth, I was baptized there and made my communion there. This church, built around 1850, was commissioned by Napoleon III for the town where he spent his childhood. Indeed his mother, Queen Hortense, wife of Louis Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon I, lived there for a long time in the castle, which has now disappeared. This church, of modest architecture, still has remarkable centers of interest. The tombs of the Bonaparte family and personalities of the empire such as that of Marshal Ney. Note the marble monument in memory of Louis Bonaparte, king of Holland and husband of Queen Hortense, but also the statue of the Virgin Mary in Carrara marble offered by the Pope. Finally, a very interesting organ of small size but very representative of the art of the famous maker Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll, which adds to the interest of the building. An essential visit for all art and history lovers.",5 years ago,2025-01-24 12:20:07.974126,5.0,Bernard Chaudey,50,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113387123044114680307/reviews?hl=en-GB
