ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndU1lSklBEAE,"Say mom, before Instagram what was there? There were shoe boxes gathering dust on top of a shelf, filled with photos, organized by year. There were albums whose gentle sound of pages turning as they peeled off from each other, separated by tracing paper, marked our Sunday afternoons at Grandma's. There were slide shows in the living room transformed into a cinema. Curtains drawn and slide tray well organized.  We are sure that you keep these few priceless relics at home, others have chosen to make an exhibition of them at the Maison de la Photographie Robert Doisneau in Gentilly. Michel Frizot and Cédric de Veigy visited the Flea Market to create this “Photos Trouvées” exhibition. A collection of amateur photos from the 20th Century, intended to be framed, slipped into a wallet or a book and which end up in the museum!  No poses, or almost. Just real life and a lot of spontaneity. It’s your turn to try to imagine the before and after of each of these photos.
