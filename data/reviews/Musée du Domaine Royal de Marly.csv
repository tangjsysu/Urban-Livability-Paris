ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHX2RiSkR3EAE,"What a joy to visit here. This museum has been recently renovated and it shows. The collection is well balanced and tells basically two stories. One of the not-so-well-known parts of the life of Louis XIV, who had a palace on this estate he used for private events. The other is the story of the famed Marly Machine, a system to pump water from the Seine and bring it up to Marly (and then on to Versailles) to use in the fountains and ponds. The friendly and knowledgeable staff will tell you all about this, and you will be happy to have learned something not everybody knows about.",3 years ago,2025-03-15 23:09:59.101839,4.0,Arjan Tupan,472,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117849011127857260399/reviews?hl=en-US

It's a shame that the tranquility of the place was spoiled by a member of staff who was keen to follow me like my shadow while recounting his life out loud and intelligibly to his new colleague who seemed as embarrassed as me. As a result, to my great despair, I learned more about his life than about the Ch√¢teau de Marly, the machine and the horses...  Apart from this very unpleasant social experience, the museum is very interesting, very well documented and the scenography is well done.
