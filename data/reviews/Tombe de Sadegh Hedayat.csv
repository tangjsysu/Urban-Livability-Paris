ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyNXJtcVhnEAE,"Hedayat is considered one of the greatest writers of modern Iran. He is a contemporary, among others, of the Iranian writers Houshang Golshiri, Mohammad-Ali Djamalzadeh and Sadegh Choubak. It is to Hedayat that we owe true romantic writing for the first time in Iran, because before him literature was almost exclusively represented by poetry, with its particular prosody.  He is especially famous for his novel The Blind Owl, hailed by the surrealists when it was published in French in 1953.  Author of a twilight and unusual literature, haunted by his demons and living on the margins of society, he takes a desperate look, tinged with merciless irony, on the absurdity of the world and the incurable madness of the human soul . A free spirit in the tradition of Omar Khayyam ‚Äì whose Songs he published a critical edition ‚Äì, he was also an iconoclastic satirist, influenced both by the modern masters of Europe, notably Franz Kafka, and by folklore and the traditions of ancient Persia.  Incurable pessimist, great lover of vodka and opium, Hedayat committed suicide in poverty and extreme solitude in April 1951 in his apartment on rue Championnet, in Paris.",5 months ago,2024-12-27 20:00:12.286073,5.0,SAITAMA„Çµ„Ç§„Çø„Éû,16,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100551597895579334287/reviews?hl=en
