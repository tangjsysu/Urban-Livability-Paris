ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0cEllWHV3RRAB,"We accidentally stumbled upon this incredible church in Sept, so when I found myself back in Paris in Jan with my boys, I had to bring them here.  This is 1 of the most beautiful churches I've ever been into & I make it a point to go into every church I possibly can, wherever I visit.  It's right next to The Louvre, so if you find yourself in that area (& who doesn't when visiting Paris), then I absolutely recommend this gem.   It's truly spectacular & well worth the time.  In fact, every time I visit Paris, I will definitely visit here.  It's free to visit & you can purchase candles to light inside via cash, apple pay or Google wallet.  Even if you aren't spiritual,  there's something about being in these beautiful,  historical places that is just magical.",10 months ago,2024-12-27 20:11:17.662098,5.0,Tammy K,52,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109465950229083750043/reviews?hl=en-GB

The choir and the first bay of the chapel of the Virgin date from the 14th century, the nave and the present porch from the following century, the transept and the choir chapels from the 16th century.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvX1k3TXdBRRAB,"The Church of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois is a 15th-century church located at Place du Louvre just east of the museum on the Right Bank. This is an attractive building with Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance features that is worth viewing if you enjoy seeing historic churches during your travels.  The history of the church dates back to the 7th century however, it was reconstructed several times over the centuries. The present church contains 13th-century sections while its bulk seems to come from the 15th-century.  What you will see is a delightful exterior, an impressively decorated porch with carved pillars and large rose windows, the works of Jean Gaussel. There is a medieval tower in front of the church that is nice to view as well.  Within Eglise St-Germain l'Auxerrois you will find a traditional narrow nave with high vaulted ceiling and pulpit. There are beautiful stained-glass windows as well as an impressive altarpieces of stone and wooden sculptures. Do spend a couple minutes in the side chapel near the back of the church where you are treated to beautiful frescos behind the altar.  In the end, this is a really nice church, one that we much enjoyed viewing during our recent stay in Pais.
