ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzLTVlMVFBEAE,"A magnificent medieval church in the Marais district — Notre-Dame des Blancs Manteaux. The name comes from the Servite monks who wore white mantles and founded the first church here in 1258. The church was rebuilt in the French classical style between 1685 and 1690. Inside, you can find a beautifully carved wooden pulpit from 1749 and a collection of paintings and sculptures. During the European Heritage Days, we were allowed to visit the organist’s workplace, where he explained the organ’s structure and shared insights about playing this impressive instrument.",a month ago,2024-12-27 20:16:10.383076,5.0,Ivan Bondar,54,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109642391137410385536/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYd3VfLWlRRRAB,"In between two beautiful streets in the Marais, is this little (not so little) gem of a gothic church!  The OG church was built in 1258 but it was rebuilt in the 1600s.  I love the carved wood pulpit which is a work of art!  Mostly on a hot day walking the Marias, it is a cool respite of calm!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkdTdiZC1RRRAB,"Discovering the Notre Dame des Blancs Manteaux church in Paris was an unforgettable experience, accentuated by the magic of a concert within its walls. Nestled in the heart of the Marais, this church proves to be a haven of peace and beauty, far from the hustle and bustle of Paris. Its discreet facade hides an interior imbued with spirituality and history, where each stone seems to tell a part of the capital's past. Attending a concert in this building was a moment of pure grace, where the music seemed to rise and blend perfectly with the solemn and sacred atmosphere of the place. This church is not only a historical monument; it is a living place, which welcomes and enchants those who are lucky enough to discover its hidden treasures.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4dW9yNVhnEAE,"Very strange that it was only after our fifth visit to Paris that we came to know this church, given its historical value. The first building dates back to 1258, undergoing a radical renovation in the 17th century and, after the famous Notre Dame Cathedral, it is the oldest church in Paris dedicated to the Holy Virgin. It was taken during the French Revolution and sold as national property.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyX0lUaENBEAE,"Very cute little Parisian church with charming austerity and integrated into the neighborhood in a very beautiful way since on its side we find the charming Langlois park, very popular with young parents. I quite like the clarity that we can find inside the building with this magnificent light coming through which gives the place a quite unique personality while allowing us to admire the work of the stained glass windows. There are beautiful works there, notably a series dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, ranging from paintings to statues. The first church having been erected by the servants of the Holy Virgin (whose color of clothing gave the name to the Church and to the rue des Blancs Manteaux) it is not surprising to see this theme preserved in a chapel dedicated to her.
