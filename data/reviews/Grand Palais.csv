ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmc2FhVExnEAE,"Extremely Disorganized and Unsafe Experience at Grand Palais Skating Rink  Our visit to the Grand Palais skating rink was an absolute disappointment. We booked tickets for the 9 PM timeslot, expecting a smooth and organized experience. However, upon arrival, we were shocked to see over 500 people waiting in line. After standing in line for 45 minutes with almost no progress, we approached a security guard who informed us we would likely have to wait another 90 minutes to enter.  What is the point of assigning timeslots if they are not enforced? This level of disorganization completely defeats the purpose and results in chaos for paying customers.  Additionally, safety is a major concern. Based on what we observed, there were already at least 300 people inside the skating rink. The space was clearly overcrowded, with far too many skaters per square meter. This raises serious questions about the safety of participants, both in terms of skating collisions and the lack of any feasible plan for emergency evacuations. The venue’s capacity seemed dangerously exceeded, putting everyone at risk.  Grand Palais needs to address its booking system, crowd management, and safety standards immediately. This experience was not only frustrating but also concerning on multiple levels. We would not recommend this to anyone until these issues are resolved.",2 weeks ago,2025-01-24 14:18:24.031758,1.0,Arghavan Rastegari,432,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109805246386696584720/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfM3ZTNjRRRRAB,"During my recent visit to Paris, I was awestruck by the Grand Palais, particularly its magnificent Nave. As I stood beneath the colossal glass roof, I couldn't help but marvel at the sheer scale of the structure. A tour guide mentioned an intriguing fact that left me amazed - the Nave apparently contains more steel than the iconic Eiffel Tower itself!  The guide explained that this architectural wonder was constructed for the Universal Exhibition of 1900, showcasing the pinnacle of engineering at the turn of the century. As I gazed up at the intricate metalwork supporting the vast expanse of glass, I tried to imagine the immense amount of steel used in its construction.  What truly captivated me was the glass roof itself. Stretching as far as the eye could see, it created a sense of openness and light that was simply breathtaking. I learned that it's considered the largest of its kind in Europe, which only added to my appreciation of this remarkable building.  Standing there, I felt a deep sense of admiration for the visionaries who created this masterpiece. The Grand Palais, to me, perfectly embodies the French spirit of pushing boundaries in both technology and art. It's a testament to human ingenuity and a must-see for anyone visiting Paris who appreciates architectural marvels.",4 days ago,2025-01-24 14:18:24.032758,4.0,George Benaroya,380,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102310139501387459611/reviews?hl=en-GB
