While the wait time can be a bit long due to no reservations, once seated, the ambiance adds to the charm. The cafe's small size may lead to cramped conditions, but the food makes up for it. The Tulum-style avocado toast, with its unique addition of pomegranate, stands out as a flavorful choice. The croissants are a highlight, perfectly balanced between softness and crispiness. However, the scrambled eggs with mushrooms and pesto could use better seasoning. Improving the seating arrangements to provide more comfort would enhance the overall dining experience.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3bDdmeEFnEAE,"The avocado toast with pomegranates was very good and a surprising choice, the singular slice surprised me as it was 13 euros for this singular slice of avocado on toast, but it was very good. I think for the outrageous prices this place felt a bit like a tourist trap to me but the food was good so it's not the worst you can do. My mother ordered the French toast and that was very good too, but again it was also a singular slice that cost 14 euros I believe. To make the price worth it I feel like they would just need to add some accompaniments to the dishes, like some potato wedges or a few slices of fruit, an egg or something. Just something to make it less astonishing when your 13 euros worth of food that comes out from the kitchen looks tiny even on the teeny tiny plate it was served on.  I asked for ice in my macchiato because I was tired of hot drinks every morning and the servers seemed shocked, which was kind of funny. They put a singular cube of ice in the tiny espresso cup which was also funny, I feel like the french don't understand that the espresso still taste like an espresso if you put it in a different cup.",4 months ago,2025-01-24 14:04:20.146261,4.0,tea fuko,10,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104198320458163686349/reviews?hl=en
