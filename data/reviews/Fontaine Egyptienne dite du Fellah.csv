ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnbk12WWh3RRAB,"Having wanted to show a spirit of initiative in terms of seduction, I hastened to attract the girl in need of Egyptian art. What was my disappointment when I noticed that the surrounding space had no comfortable area in which to sit (we shared it), straight away. Worse, a lot of trash littered the ground. Already my plans were thwarted, the statue was revealed to be in a most deplorable state, an execution taking us back to the darkest hours of pharaonic Egypt.",6 years ago,2024-12-27 21:32:52.063396,1.0,ChanceOregon68,3,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111574437900601239224/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcUotbWpBRRAB,"EGYPTIAN FOUNTAIN called FELLAH The¬†Fontaine du Fellah¬†is a fountain located at no. 42 Rue de S√®vres, Paris (7th), next to the entrance to the¬†Vaneau metro station. A fine example of the neo-Egyptian style, popular in France after Bonaparte's¬†Egyptian campaign between 1798 and 1801. Its name evokes the Egyptian¬†fellah, but the statue would rather represent¬†Antinous, the favorite of Emperor Hadrian, it is very visibly inspired by the ancient statue discovered in 1739 in the emperor's sumptuous villa, near¬†Tivoli, kept at the Museum of the Vatican. The Fellah Fountain is one of the 15 fountains built in Paris between 1806 and 1807 on the orders of Napoleon following the opening of the Ourcq canal. (The¬†fellah¬†traditionally designates an Arab peasant from the Maghreb). It was built in 1806, and, like the¬†Fontaine de Mars, its plans were by the engineer Fran√ßois-Jean Bralle and the sculpted decorations were made by Pierre-Nicolas Beauvalet, a student of Augustin Pajou. The current statue is a copy made in 1930 (or 1844) by Jean-Fran√ßois-Th√©odore Gechter of the Beauvalet statue. Under the name of ""Egyptian Fountain"", registration as a historic monument since July 25, 1977 at the Laennec hospital. The Fellah Fountain is a wall-mounted fountain measuring 2.8 meters high. The arch of the statue evokes the entrance to a temple. In a niche, a life-size statue of an Egyptian peasant carries in each hand an amphora from which water escapes. Collected in a semi-circular basin, the water then flowed onto the ground into a sump from a bronze mask with the head of a lion. On the pediment of the building, an eagle with outstretched wings symbolizes the Empire, replacing the behdety, the winged solar disk of ancient Egypt, recalling the Empire.",3 years ago,2024-12-27 21:32:52.063396,5.0,Jean Marco92,643,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114146936200095763256/reviews?hl=en-GB
