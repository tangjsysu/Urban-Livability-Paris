ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRMGY3R01BEAE,"My favorite place visited in Paris. Originally went to simply find the grave of Claude Debussy, my favorite composer; but I found so much more! Americans like me, especially those over 40, will surely recognize many of France's most famous names here, especially those from the fields of music, art, fashion, politics and perfumery. Even some famed non-French greats may be found here, like the Shah of Iran's daughter who committed suicide when she was 31. Her grave is always adorned by live flowers. This is an especially good place to go if the day is hot and the tourists too thick. It is cool, shady, solitary and quiet here -- a feast for the eyes and soul.
