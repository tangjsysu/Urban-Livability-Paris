ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhN3RLbkhnEAE,"SMALLEST HOUSE in PARIS - 39 Rue du Château d‘Eau - Paris (10th): The facade is 1.20 m wide, 5 m high and 3 m deep, made up of a single bay. It has a tiny shop on the ground floor and a first floor which did not even communicate when it was built. This first floor is now accessible from an apartment in the neighboring building, at 41 rue.
