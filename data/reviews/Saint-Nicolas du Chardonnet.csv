ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMeDliTWt3RRAB,What an absolutely beautiful church. Passed by her just by sheer luck and was so happy. The interior is probably one of the most beautiful I've ever been into. It was quite old but beautifully kept. It was packed when I went in there as I entered near the end of mass. It was so lovely to see every talking outside.,5 months ago,2024-12-27 20:13:59.788665,5.0,Brid,417,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118364008054074247056/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiaXZuNU5REAE,"I am Catholic and recently went to a church in Paris to pray after hearing the bell chime. To my surprise, I was quickly ushered out because I was wearing shorts. I was dressed in a plain T-shirt and shorts due to the summer heat. This experience was quite shocking, as I have never been escorted out of a church before.  I believe that the core tenet of Christianity is to come as you are, and being overly strict about dress code can be off-putting to people seeking spiritual connection. It's concerning when organized religion becomes too focused on appearance rather than the message of acceptance and love. Despite the situation, I was dressed appropriately for the weather and looked quite cute in my Orlebar Brown outfit.",5 months ago,2024-12-27 20:13:59.789666,1.0,Josh Blanco,2,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111329056149049608406/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdWJDOVBnEAE,"Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet is a church just off Saint Germain Boulevard near the Maubert - Mutualité Metro Station. Opening hours are 7am to 8.30pm daily.  Originally build in the 13th century, the church has been reconstructed a handful of times over the centuries. The exterior facade is subtle and simple, the interior features some nice side chapels with large scale frescos. The main alter and inner dome work are particularly nice to see. This section of the church was lit up during our visit by a light being shone on the Mary and Child sculpture at the main alter. Much of the rest of the interior was rather dark limiting how well you can see and photograph what is inside.  Overall, we liked our short visit to Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet. It is an attractive church worth spending a few minutes to enjoy if you plan to spend time or pass through this area of Paris. It is not too far from Notre Dame Cathedral if looking for other places to combine with a visit here. If you want to stay on the Left Bank, Eglise Saint-Ephrem-le-Syriaque, Saint-Étienne-du-Mont and the Pantheon are within relatively short distance as well.",5 years ago,2024-12-27 20:13:59.789666,3.0,Brad,"5,430",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB
