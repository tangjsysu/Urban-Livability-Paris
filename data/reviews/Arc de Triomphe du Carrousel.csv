ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyOE4zdC1BRRAB,"The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, located near the Louvre in Paris, is a captivating monument that often gets overshadowed by its larger counterpart, the Arc de Triomphe at the end of the Champs-√âlys√©es. However, this smaller triumphal arch, situated between the Louvre and the Tuileries Garden, offers its own unique charm and historical significance.  Commissioned by Napoleon I to commemorate his military victories in 1805, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel is a masterpiece of Neoclassical architecture. Its intricate reliefs and sculptures celebrate the achievements of the French army, and the exquisite details are a testament to the artistic excellence of the period. Topped with a magnificent chariot and four horses, the arch provides a striking visual anchor in the heart of Paris.  One of the most appealing aspects of this monument is its accessibility. Unlike the often crowded Arc de Triomphe, the Carrousel offers a more serene and intimate viewing experience. Visitors can walk around and through the arch, taking in the fine details up close without the hustle and bustle typically found at more popular tourist sites.  The location of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel is also a major highlight. Nestled in the historical axis that stretches from the Louvre to the Place de la Concorde, it provides a picturesque backdrop for photos and a perfect starting point for a leisurely stroll through the Tuileries Garden. The proximity to the Louvre makes it a convenient stop for those already planning to visit the museum.  Overall, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel is a gem that offers both historical significance and aesthetic beauty. It's a must-see for history buffs, art lovers, and anyone looking to experience the rich cultural tapestry of Paris without the crowds.",5 months ago,2024-12-27 21:13:00.638228,5.0,AsabaYT,219,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117340127793286548297/reviews?hl=en

It is an example of Neoclassical architecture in the Corinthian order.[1] It was built between 1806 and 1808 to commemorate Napoleon's military victories of the previous year. The Arc de Triomphe de l'√âtoile, at the far end of the Champs √âlys√©es, was designed in the same year; it is about twice the size and was not completed until 1836.  The monument is 63 feet (19 m) high, 75 feet (23 m) wide, and 24 feet (7.3 m) deep.[2] The 21 feet (6.4 m) high central arch is flanked by two smaller ones, 14 feet (4.3 m) high, and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide. Around its exterior are eight Corinthian columns of marble, topped by eight soldiers of the Empire. On the pediment, between the soldiers, bas-reliefs depict:  the Arms of the Kingdom of Italy with figures representing History and the Arts the Arms of the French Empire with Victory, Fame, History, and Abundance Wisdom and Strength holding the arms of the Kingdom of Italy, accompanied by Prudence and Victory. Napoleon's diplomatic and military victories are commemorated by bas-reliefs executed in rose marble. They depict:  the Peace of Pressburg Napoleon entering Munich Napoleon entering Vienna, sculptor Louis-Pierre Deseine the Battle of Austerlitz, sculptor Jean-Joseph Espercieux the Tilsit Conference the surrender of Ulm, sculptor Pierre Cartellier The arch is derivative of the triumphal arches of the Roman Empire, in particular that of Septimius Severus in Rome. The subjects of the bas-reliefs devoted to the battles were selected by the director of the Napoleon Museum (Paris) (located at the time in the Louvre), Vivant Denon, and designed by Charles Meynier.  The upper frieze on the on entablement has sculptures of soldiers: Auguste Marie Taunay's cuirassier (left), Charles-Louis Corbet's dragoon, Joseph Chinard's horse grenadier and Jacques-Edme Dumont's sapper.
