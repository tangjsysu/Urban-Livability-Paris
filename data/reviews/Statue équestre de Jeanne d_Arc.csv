ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNbC1xT3V3RRAB,"A chance discovery. Walked past this equestrian statue of Joan of Arc in an almost obscure street in Nancy. I don't know much about it and not mentioned in ""things to discover in Nancy"" but happy to have past and seen it. I read up it's history after and it was erected in 1890 in a square bearing her name. Not much else except it's a magnificent monument to see. It's not every tourist's cup of tea, but if you stumble across it, pause and explore.",5 years ago,2025-01-24 11:51:03.394520,5.0,Antoine M,"1,963",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113493032279416500253/reviews?hl=en-GB
