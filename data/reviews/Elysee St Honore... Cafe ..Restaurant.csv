We professionally informed the waitress she agreed it didn’t look great and would try her best to obtain a refund. Then came the point that the Manager rudely stated nothing wring with it my chef tasted it and it’s as we normally make it (maybe time for a new chef) Manager not interested in customers views this is no doubt going to damage the business long term with loss of customers and also customers informing others to stay clear.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmazU2SkpREAE,"A very, very bad experience. We had reserved a table for New Year's Eve. Obviously the restaurant had taken many more reservations than capacity and was overbooked. There were about 100 people at the entrance, all of whom had made reservations and had been waiting for several hours. The man at the entrance was very rude, no explanations and no courtesy for the guests who had made reservations. Instead, a couple of guests who had just arrived were admitted because they apparently ""knew"" the man at the entrance. A very, very disappointing experience, the worst in Paris. Can't say anything about the cuisine because we didn't try it, but hopefully it's different from the organization of the restaurant.... We then had an excellent dinner in the restaurant opposite ""Do re mi"".
