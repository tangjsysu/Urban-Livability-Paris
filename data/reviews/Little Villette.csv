ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfNDdLWVBnEAE,"The LEGO space, although slightly renovated and reorganized, has lost its simplicity and sympathy. We are now refused entry in a way that borders on refusing entry to a poor quality nightclub, then having people enter right after us, tough for our 3 year old child. Unlimited access on site by maintaining a gauge no longer allows as many passages. We appreciated the little fun breaks in this place in the middle of our walks in the park, too bad.",a month ago,2025-03-15 22:23:17.775483,1.0,Lucie Wendremaire,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109383139400450681317/reviews?hl=en-US

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcXVXamVBEAE,"Scandalous! The lady who was in charge of the kite workshop this Sunday July 4 should not work with children!! At reception, the hostess registered my 4-year-old daughter for the workshop, telling me that I should help her because the minimum age was 5 years old. When we arrived at the workshop, without any pity or tact in front of all the children, the facilitator failed us, leaving my daughter disappointed and in tears. When we work with children of this age, we make a minimum of effort to learn to speak to them and explain things to them educationally. I don't see why it was awkward to let her try... We were then directed to a paper flower workshop which lasted 2 minutes then we went to the “cinema” projection room where the cartoon did not start… in short, a 35 minute drive for a total disappointment!",3 years ago,2025-03-15 22:23:17.785739,1.0,Marina DE CASTRO,6,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111713533230850034465/reviews?hl=en
