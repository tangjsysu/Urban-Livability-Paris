ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJcF9IUzZBRRAB,"The Lubavitcher Rebbe during his stay in Paris (1733 - 1379) prayed and met here from time to time. The area was at the time a Jewish area and today there are few kosher shops left of it but mainly a tourist area. The Rebbe said here some of his famous notes about Hanukkah and more. For those interested in getting here from the airport: ror b line to the shuttle and there change to metro no. 1 until the Saint Paul station closest to the synagogue. The building is locked and you have to wait for the neighbor to open it, the synagogue is on the second floor and you should ask a friend from Paris for the code to the synagogue.",6 years ago,2025-01-24 11:23:04.814429,5.0,a s,221,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105693983545172163587/reviews?hl=en
