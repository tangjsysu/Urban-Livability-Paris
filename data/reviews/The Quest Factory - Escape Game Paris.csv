ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKLTltVndRRRAB,"ðŸŒŸ Super awesome experience! ðŸŒŸ I came on a work trip to Paris (by work trip I mean I work at an escape room and we came to Paris to play a bunch of them) and our group did the Cannibal Island and Operation Balkan. Personally I did the Cannibal Island, and it had one of the coolest puzzlesðŸ©¸and some of the best set and effects ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ out of all the rooms I've ever done (I've played over 60 over the years). Our game master Emma struggled with the English but still managed to give us an amazing experience and helped us along the way just enough to let us meander and get scared* and solve puzzles, but still manage to escape on time! Cause I did speak French and was the only one in the group to do so I got the vibe that if language wasn't a barrier, all the acting bits and the whole spiel would've been even more on point, but props anyway for still making it an awesome experience! *About the getting scared part, oh my god I am one of the startliest people you will ever meet, and jesus christ did I have a field day.

The adventure is original, the puzzles very coherent, the level of difficulty is quite high, the quality of the scenery and the immersion has been pushed to its peak.  Frankly, the scourge is an excellent surprise and a great pleasure under the control of GM Hugo!!!  Cannibal Island is an older room with already well-established and known puzzles and mechanisms. The story is playful, amusing with a very good role for GM Hugues. Shorter in time, its level of difficulty is accessible to everyone. The settings, and certain puzzles are absolutely incredible... The perfect cross between Koh Lanta and Mac Gyver.  A final word to finish, thank you to Hugo and Hugues for their sympathy and professionalism.
