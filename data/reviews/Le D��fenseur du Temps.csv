ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYanNtWjNBRRAB,"Since February 2024 is working again! Every hour the Defender of Time is fighting against one of the randomly selected animal: the crab, the rooster or the dragon (representing sea, sky and earth). Each spectacle  starts with 3 strokes, then we can hear the sounds of a chosen element.  At noon, 6 pm, and 10pm, all three animals attack at the same time. If you want to see and hear it properly, choose noon rather - there’s a bistro opposite the clock and could be busy (and noisy!).",2 months ago,2024-12-28 15:09:08.578555,5.0,K D,23,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107536574871594765438/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBdnJmWmlBRRAB,"This hidden gem is actually a piece of mechanical art with short but interesting history and even shorter life. Commissioned in 1975 by a private company it was inaugurated in 1979 by Jacques Chirac - Mayor of Paris at this time. The automated mechanism was designed to put in motion a set of figures - a man with sword and a shield fighting randomly a bird, a dragon and a crab (air, earth and water) thus defending time. At noon, 6pm and 10pm all tree animals attack at the same time. This scene was accompanied by sounds of breaking waves, rumbling earth or the sound of wind, depending on the animal chosen.
