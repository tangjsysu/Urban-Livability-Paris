ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzcXV2ekNnEAE,"The restaurant is well known for pink color and it’s a tourist spot for pictures so do expect to see many people outside. It’s quite charming with cozy atmosphere.  We find that the food was fine but if you expect that you gonna say wow from your first bite then this might not be a place for you. The best dish from what we ordered was the meatball, very soft, tasteful and we would recommend it. We don’t remember the name of another main dish, unfortunately we find that it is quite chewy for us.  We were seated on upper floor with beautiful decoration. You might feel it might be a bit cramped  when all seats are occupied. There is only one staff took care all the table on our floor.

Went to check the menu and seems attractive. Asked the host if I need to reserve a table. Was told they are kinda fully booked but able to sit me in when kitchen opened. Was tired walking around the area and decided to just get sit in for a drink while waiting for the kitchen to open. Well, the restaurant was far from fully booked 😂 guess the host trying to create a demand. Lol. Anyway, ordered a veal dish as main and a carrot cake for dessert. Veal was well cooked and goes well with the gravy. So does the side potatoes. Would rate it 9/10. As for the carrot cake, maybe a 7/10.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfZ09iRndBRRAB,"La Maison Rose is a charming, pastel-pink café located in the heart of Montmartre, Paris. With its distinctive color and picturesque appearance, it has become one of the most iconic spots in the neighborhood. The café has a rich history, once frequented by famous artists such as Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani during the early 20th century, when Montmartre was the hub of artistic creativity. Originally a small café and later a meeting place for local creatives, La Maison Rose has retained its historic charm and continues to attract visitors from around the world.  The café’s story is deeply intertwined with the artistic bohemia of Montmartre, and its exterior remains an emblem of the area’s vibrant cultural heritage. Today, La Maison Rose serves as a lovely spot to enjoy a coffee or meal while soaking in the artistic history of Montmartre, making it a must-visit for anyone exploring this historic district.",3 days ago,2025-01-24 13:58:49.735461,5.0,Ufuk Yüksekkaya,141,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107733891821077966154/reviews?hl=en-GB

So much thought in the design and appearance—even more beautiful than the outside if you can imagine it! The food was some of the best we had in Paris (which is saying a lot!). The vegetables were fresh, the drinks were delicious and had fresh flower petals (I recommend the Gertrude!). There were even options for people with dietary restrictions. The service on top of it was fantastic—genuine warmth from the wait staff and the owner came and chatted with us about the history of the restaurant and her love of seasonal food.
