ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbXJXakl3EAE,"Simply amazing and amazingly simple, this rare historical gem hidden in plain sight offers more than an eye of the beholder catches. This truly stunning edifice is nothing short of an architectural feast, elaborate yet somewhat reserve in its style, a mixture of classic grandeur and noble modesty.

The ambience this tiny yet gracious hotel imparts upon a visitor is almost mystique, yet so authentic. As visitor, you are ushered into its historic legacy, almost untainted by the vicissitudes of time, countless wars, revolutions, tragedies and other destructive forces.
