ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3NXRTUWNREAE,"The church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs is a Catholic building of worship in Paris, located in the 3rd arrondissement. The building, in late Gothic style, dates back to the 12th, 15th and 17th centuries; it is a historical monument of France. The main pipe organ of the church, currently not functioning, is one of the oldest in Paris still in existence and preserved almost intact in its original conformation. It is located on the choir loft on the counter-façade, and was built in 1772-1776 by Francois-Henri Clicquot, who reused the case of the previous instrument, built by Paul Maillard in 1608-1611 and rebuilt by Crespin Carlier in 1632. Subsequently it underwent small modifications until restoration by Victor Gonzalez from 1929-1930, who added an expressive section to the third manual, later disconnected. With its 56 stops on five manuals and pedal, it is the largest classical French organ in the city. It has been a historical monument since 1927. On the floor in the eleventh bay of the internal left side nave, there is a smaller instrument, built by John Abbey in 1843 and enlarged by Pierre Chéron 1950-1952. With electric transmission, it has 23 registers on two manuals and pedal.",4 months ago,2024-12-27 20:16:51.201364,5.0,daniele pedroni,"1,662",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106356302369543242970/reviews?hl=en
