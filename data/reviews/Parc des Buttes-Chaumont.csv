ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNndG9HVjlBRRAB,"Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, located in northeastern Paris, is one of the cityâ€™s most distinctive and picturesque parks. Covering over 61 acres, it offers a refreshing contrast to the more formal and structured gardens typical of Paris, such as the Jardin des Tuileries or Luxembourg Gardens. Opened in 1867 under Napoleon III, the park is known for its dramatic landscape, featuring steep cliffs, winding paths, waterfalls, and a man-made lake.  One of the parkâ€™s most iconic features is the Temple de la Sibylle, perched atop a cliff on the ÃŽle de la BelvÃ©dÃ¨re, offering panoramic views of Paris, including a stunning perspective of Montmartre. The parkâ€™s elevation changes provide a unique topography, with caves, grottos, and bridges that add a sense of adventure to every walk. Its design, inspired by the Romantic English gardens, creates an atmosphere of wild beauty, enhanced by the parkâ€™s carefully curated but naturalistic landscaping.  Parc des Buttes-Chaumont is a haven for locals and tourists alike, providing ample spaces for picnics, relaxation, and outdoor activities. The park is particularly popular with families and joggers, offering several playgrounds and scenic trails. Its diversity of flora, alongside occasional art installations and cafÃ©s, makes it a dynamic and vibrant space to explore.

We got some croissants and pastries, some lemonades and had our Kindles. I had always wanted to visit here but upon arrival we found that the hill and bridge were inaccessible. This was upsetting. The other thing that kind of ruined the day was lack of toilets. I have never gone to a large park and had no bathrooms. There were portajohns without toilet paper and absolutely unwelcoming so we had to leave to go find washrooms before starting our peaceful stay. We sat by the water on one of the benches under a large tree. It was the epitome of peaceful until ... it seemed every school in that district had a field trip occur. I actually loved seeing the children play - it reminded me of when I taught in England but just a head's up if you go on a weekday it may not be quiet. The park was clean and well maintained.

It was a Monday rather than a weekend and  it was really hot and sunny but we easily found a space to eat a picnic.  and weren't bothered by crowds at all.
