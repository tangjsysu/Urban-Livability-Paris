ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURnMklENnlBRRAB,Superb museum which popularizes certain mathematical concepts in order to introduce children to mathematical concepts. The museum is not very big but is definitely worth the detour. Online reservations are REQUIRED and the museum is free for children. I highly recommend.
