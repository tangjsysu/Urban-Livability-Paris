This beautiful place is very well maintained, despite the lack of respect from certain users who frequent the place and leave lots of papers on the ground, mainly in the summer when there are trash cans for that.Regarding the fishermen of which I am one. I find it unacceptable that we pay for a fishing license and cannot fish in good conditions while the people who maintain the surroundings of the canal throw all their plant waste into it. They have managed to equip a vehicle which passes on the path with a machine which clears the path by evacuating the leaves into the canal. Which means that at times, we encounter great difficulty in being able to fish because there are so many grasses, leaves and foliage drifting on the surface of the water.  Furthermore, there are too many walkers who let their dogs loose, without keeping them on a leash, while there are families with children who walk along the canal, without forgetting the wildlife.  At times, cross bikes and quads circulate freely there, although this is prohibited.",5 years ago,2025-01-24 13:38:47.863512,3.0,monty monty,79,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109701096500107292346/reviews?hl=en
