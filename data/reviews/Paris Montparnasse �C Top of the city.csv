ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYNXVyeW5RRRAB,You can get there by train and buy tickets on site. Their closing time 10 pm.  I recommend to get there at around 5 or 6 pm to observe the city from above and spot different places in Paris; then wait till dawn and see the Eiffel Tower lights spectacle at every hour from 7 pm for 5 min.  The rooftop definitely can be improved to make the experience more interesting.,2 months ago,2024-12-28 16:28:46.489062,4.0,Maria Jaimes,13,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116170270423114031977/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyLTdIRzZBRRAB,"The best view you will ever get in all of Paris! The tower has a viewing platform which you can reach through express elevators and a few steps and the platform itself is covered from wind by huge glass sheets with viewing cutouts for cameras and binoculars (which there are a few of already installed and usable for one or two euros). They seem to also have installations to protect visitors from rain directly above the mentioned glass sheets and also through ""curtains"" over some parts of the platforms main area.  There are uncomfortable-looking but quite-comfortable-once-youre-seated red chairs which allow you to enjoy the sun without too much wind, which is great on sunny days. You should bring sun protection if you plan to stay there longer on sunny days as there isn't anything throwing shadows.  Again, the view onto every part of the city is excellent, this includes Sacre Coeur, the Eiffel tower, Louvre, Notre-Dame and more. For some, you may need a zoom-enabled camera or binoculars, but you can see everything.  For 15 euros, this is a must-visit.  A souvenir shop and restaurant is located a few floors below the platform but we didnt visit them.  There's also an inside area close to them which allows viewing most of the attractions during bad weather but I recommend going here only if there's at least less clouds so you get the nicest views from the top of the tower.  The platform is centered with some distance to the edges of the building so people afraid of heights shouldn't have problems staying here without being afraid. The elevators are closed (no glass elevators, also important for people afraid of heights).  Go here! You may regret it if you don't.
