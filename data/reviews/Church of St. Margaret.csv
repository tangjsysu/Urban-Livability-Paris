ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRZ3VhRWtnRRAB,"In 1624, Jean de Vitry donated land to Antoine Fayet, priest of Saint Paul, who built a chapel dedicated to Saint Marguerite of Antioch. From a branch church in 1634 it became a parish church in 1712.  During the French Revolution, the bodies of 300 people guillotined on the Bastille and Nation squares were buried in the cemetery of the same church and, according to legend, Louis XVII was buried in the latter after his death at the Temple prison. .

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRa3M2U3VBRRAB,"From the outside, the nondescript church is one of the last in Paris to have an adjoining cemetery. It was long believed that Louis XVII as a child, after his death in the Temple Prison, had been buried here. We have since known that this is false. You should not miss visiting it, because this church is the only one to have a ""Chapel of the Souls of Purgatory"" listed as a Historic Monument in 1960. It is all decorated in ""Trompe l'Oeil"" in a neo-classical Greek style. .. This is absolutely remarkable and astonishing!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSak9DcU93EAE,"Well-preserved architectural ensemble.    It would be nice if the Paris City Hall wanted to review its historical information panel and mention that the heart of the child who died at the Temple is indeed that of Louis 17. ADN, 2000. Who according to oral tradition was buried in a pit commune of the cemetery of Ste Marguerite.   His bones were never found. His heart yes, preserved by a forensic doctor, and now in St Denis.

This church, a little hidden in the small streets and near Nordling Square, doesn't look much from the outside...and it would be barely there if we didn't go in... I immediately found it quite mysterious...the lighting is all chiaroscuro, a bit like a Rembrandt painting.... Of course this famous chapel of the souls of Purgatory is quite fascinating, unfortunately closed, we can only contemplate it through the bars of the gate... The cemetery, supposed to contain poor little Louis XVII, does indeed contain the remains of 73 people guillotined in Place de la Bastille....when human cruelty gives free rein...
