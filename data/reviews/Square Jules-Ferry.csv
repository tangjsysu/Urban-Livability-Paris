ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuMU55M1J3EAE,"A rather sombre experience when I stopped at this Square Jules Ferry around Saint Ambroise area and Canal Saint Martin. There is a Memorial site that marks the spot where so many lives were taken on November 13th 2015! I was here in 2024 and still feel emotionally touched. This is actually a long public park with playgrounds for children and surrounded on both sides by beautiful Avenues filled with shops, cafÃ©s and restaurants. There's street parking available and public lavatory dotted throughout the park. This is a lovely Park area and despite the tragedy I feel people are slowly getting on with their lives. This park also complete with public toilets and many green benches for people to rest and enjoy their day.",2 months ago,2024-12-28 15:14:26.803768,5.0,Putri Dumadi,734,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104270468737476868971/reviews?hl=en-GB

Dug in 1826, the canal was covered by Boulevard Richard-Lenoir in 1860, from Avenue de la RÃ©publique to the Bastille (Port de l'Arsenal): for this it was necessary to lower its bed to make possible the boat traffic. We see in the squares, like here at Square Jules Ferry, the ventilation openings (also skylights) piercing the vaults of the buried canal: this allows those who have had the experience of this underground navigation to imagine the city in the -above ! Square Jules Ferry, like the others, is an island of freshness and (relative) calm. The atmosphere is family and serene, depending on the days of the week and times of day, of course.
