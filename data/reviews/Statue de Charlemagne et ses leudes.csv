ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzOU1XMUd3EAE,"The statue is located on the south side of the Parvis Notre-Dame – Place Jean-Paul-II, near the Seine River on the right side when looking at the Notre-Dame Cathedral. Charlemagne is depicted in old age, wearing the imperial crown of the Holy Roman Empire and wielding the scepter of Charles V, traditionally known as the ""Scepter of Charlemagne"". It is guarded by Oliver, who leads his horse, and Roland, both watching out for potential enemies on the sides. Roland carries his trademark olifant, a two-headed ax (technically a labrys but known in 19th-century France as francisca and mythically associated with the ancient Franks), and his legendary Durendal, modeled on the sword of the same name kept at the Royal Armory of Madrid. Oliver is also heavily armed, carrying a frank scramasax and holding a pike. The vigilance of the two standing figures creates a sense of foreboding that portends their heroic demise at the Battle of Roncesvalles Pass. At the same time, Charlemagne's stately and confident demeanor is indicative of his successes, which go beyond the sacrifice of the two paladins, and of his lasting legacy. The depiction is fictional and anachronistic on multiple levels, which was probably intentional to emphasize its allegorical character. Their hairstyles and clothing are those traditionally associated with Gauls or Merovingians rather than late 8th-century Franks. Legend has them both dead in 778, when Charlemagne was still young and a generation before he was crowned Emperor. Charlemagne's insignia of power were not to be worn on the battlefield. The imperial crown, in any case, was not created until more than a century after Charlemagne's death. As for the scepter, it dates back to the 14th century. The composition abounds in political and nationalistic symbolism, reflecting the Rochet brothers' intent to reclaim the legacy of Charlemagne for France and Napoleon III in line with the ideology of the Second French Empire. The implicit claim of imperial affinity between Charlemagne and Napoleon was a way to downplay the importance of the Capetian dynasty in the intervening centuries and thus to neutralize the claims of the French royalist parties of the time: the Orleanists with Philip, Count of Paris, and the Legitimists with Henry, Count of Chambord. At the same time, the presence of Roland and Oliver anchored Charlemagne to French territory and tradition against the competing claims of Belgium, then a young nation in search of iconic heroes of its own, and in particular of Germany, which was beginning its process of unification around the same time the statue was being designed. The theatrical gesture of Charlemagne, holding his ""French"" scepter above his ""German"" crown, can be seen as significant along these lines.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 12:32:03.955964,5.0,daniele pedroni,"1,726",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106356302369543242970/reviews?hl=en
