ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzbmFuOWNREAE,One of the most beautiful museums to visit in Paris. It has a lot of wildlife on display. The museum has 4 floors and is phenomenal. If you have kids then you must bring them here. And come between 4-5pm in the evening so that it gets a bit dark and the lighting in the museum keeps changing so it's really beautiful. This museum has a completely different vibe.,a month ago,2024-12-28 15:53:33.175161,5.0,Rahul Agarwal,230,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118183620553811056026/reviews?hl=en-GB

We were looking for a indoor museum for the kids during our visit to Paris because it was raining and we found this museum online.  We took our kids and we discovered such a fun and interesting place! The museum has a lot of animals and itâ€™s divided between the ocean or sea exhibition and and land animals.  They have beautiful galleries, a nice cafe and our entire family loved it.  The staff is super professional and friendly, they help us out with our luggage because we were in the run (they have lockers) and the experience was super positive.  100% recommended",3 months ago,2024-12-28 15:53:33.176161,5.0,Antonio Perez Coss,338,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114437514867320209304/reviews?hl=en-GB

The taxidermy animals are well done and the informational plaques give content as you move through different biomes and then place humanity in the larger content of the world and how we interact with life around us.
