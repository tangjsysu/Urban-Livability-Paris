ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSb18yWVlBEAE,"History abounds and you can walk past incredible things like this in Paris all day long and not even know they are there. As the sign says, translated to English: ""History of Paris Precinct of Philippe Auguste. In 1190, before his departure for the third crusade, Philippe Auguste (1165-1223) asked the inhabitants to contribute to the security of the city by the construction of a wall of about 5 km, completed around 1210. This curtain, high of ten meters and crowned with a crenellated walkway, is pierced by about ten doors. Bounded to the west by the fortress of the Louvre, built to protect it in the early years of the 13th century, to the east by the Place de Grève, to the north by Les Halles, and to the south by the town of Sainte-Geneviève, it defines a capital of 250 hectares: henceforth, the palace, the treasury and the archives are permanently fixed there, even if the king does not always reside there. This is the first attempt to unite the three Parisian districts: the ""Cité"", the religious, administrative and judicial heart, the ""Ville"", the economic center located around the ports of the right bank, and the nascent ""University"" on the left bank.",a year ago,2025-01-24 12:02:53.174662,5.0,Dan Gilkison,198,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114347242324073050770/reviews?hl=en-GB
