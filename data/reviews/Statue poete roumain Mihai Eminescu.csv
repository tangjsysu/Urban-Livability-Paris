ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtMUkzODVnRRAB,"03/02/22: Mihai Eminescu (born Mihail Eminovici; 15 January 1850, Botoşani, Moldova – 15 June 1889, Bucharest, Romania) was a Romanian poet, novelist and journalist, generally regarded as the most well-known and influential personality in Romanian literature. He published a single antum volume, Poesii, composed of poems published throughout his life in the magazine Convorbiri literare of the Junimea society, of which Eminescu was a member. Notable works include luceafărul, Ode (in the ancient meter) and the five Letters (I, II, III, IV, and V).  Being part of the late Romantic current, his poetry contains notions from metaphysics, mythology, philosophy and history, while his prose also contains sociological elements. The recurring themes in his work are nature, a theme typical of romanticism, which in Eminescu's case is viewed through the prism of local folklore, love, sometimes violent, sometimes intimate or unrequited, birth, death, cosmos and the condition of genius.  He was born in Botoşani and grew up in Ipotești, moving in his teens to Cernăuţi to attend secondary school where, at the age of 16, he published his first poem, De-aş avea. At the age of 19 he began studying philosophy at the University of Vienna, where he met the writings of authors who would strongly influence his work, such as Plato, Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant, Rousseau, and Schopenhauer, as well as Oriental philosophy through works such as the Ramayana, the Mahābhārata, and the Vedas. It was also during this period that he began to publish in the magazine Convorbiri literare. At the age of 22, he went to Berlin to continue his studies.  Eminescu returned to the country at the age of 24, initially settling in Iasi. Mihai Eminescu's journalistic activity took place between 1875 and 1877, at curierul de Iaşi, and from 1877 at Timpul, the officios of the Conservative Party, to which Eminescu was ideologically close. The newspaper articles followed the philosophical line adopted by the author, conservative but not reactionary, as he was a supporter of the social order from birth, xenophobic, anti-Semitic and bellicose nationalism, and an opponent of bourgeois liberalism. His vision was relatively common to the European nationalist authors of the time.  Exhausted by his daily work and probably suffering from bipolar disorder, Eminescu withdrew from the newspaper in June 1883. Following a nervous breakdown in 1886, his mental health problems were probably misinterpreted as symptoms of neurosyphilis, and the poet was treated with injections of mercury chloride. Eminescu died on June 15, 1889, in the sanatorium of Dr. Alexandru Şuţu, being buried two days later at bellu cemetery in Bucharest. Death was most likely due to mercury poisoning. The manuscripts of Mihai Eminescu, 46 volumes, approximately 14,000 tabs, were given to the Romanian Academy by Titu Maiorescu in 1902. He was elected a member of the Romanian Academy posthumously in 1948.",2 years ago,2024-12-27 21:16:15.174738,4.0,Mike773 U,"1,148",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100800343478060692647/reviews?hl=en-GB
