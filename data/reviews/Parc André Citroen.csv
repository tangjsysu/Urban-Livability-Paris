ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzXzUtejN3RRAB,"Visiting Parc AndrÃ© CitroÃ«n in Paris is a treat for anyone looking to explore modern design with a touch of history. Built on the former site of AndrÃ© CitroÃ«nâ€™s car factory, this huge 14-hectare park mixes bold, geometric designs with relaxing garden spaces, offering both a sense of grandeur and quiet corners to unwind.  The parkâ€™s main feature is its central lawn, bordered by greenhouses and themed gardens like Jardin Blanc and Jardin Noir. Though only accessible part of the year, the lawn and surrounding greenery are a great spot to relax or play. The parkâ€™s design is intriguing, with greenhouses displaying Mediterranean and exotic plants, and walkways that take you above the gardens, offering a new perspective. The Grand Canal, cascading fountains, and views over the Seine make it a peaceful escape where you can recharge away from city noise.  For families, the interactive fountain court and Ballon de Paris provide unforgettable experiences. The balloon ride offers a fantastic aerial view of Paris, making it a real highlight! Entry to the park is free, though certain experiences, like the balloon ride, come with a small fee.  There is a cafe-restaurant with outdoor seating where visitors can grab snacks or meals, and the childrenâ€™s play area with dancing fountains keeps kids busy and happy. Ping pong and chess tables add extra fun for enthusiasts, while the beautiful views over the Seine make it an ideal spot for everyone. Facilities like toilets and drinking water fountains make the visit more convenient.  One downside, however, is the lack of a clear map, which can make it tricky to discover all the hidden gems in this large park. Although accessible for those with reduced mobility and families with pushchairs, better signage would make it even more enjoyable. Nearby underground parking and public transport options help make the park easy to reach, welcoming both locals and tourists.  While some areas show signs of wear, Parc AndrÃ© CitroÃ«n remains a vibrant mix of history, design, and fun, set against the stunning backdrop of the Seine.",2 months ago,2025-02-09 15:30:54.314511,4.0,Muhammad Haque,548,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105179506843017317153/reviews?hl=en-US
