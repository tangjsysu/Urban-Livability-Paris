ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqMHZLSUFREAE,"From the gardens of the Palais Royal begins the Gallerie Vivienne, then the Passage des Panoramas, then the Passage Jouffroy and finally the Passage Verdeau. Exiting the Passage des Panoramas into the noise and traffic of the Boulevard Monmartre, one of the beautiful boulevards that designed by Baron Haussmann in 1860, you will see Passage Jouffroy across the street. Passage Jouffoy was built in 1846 and stood out for its fine boutiques and iconic shops with their wonderfully tuned, wooden toys. There is also the Grevin Museum of wax figures, the French equivalent of Britain's Tussauds. The entrance to the museum is not inside the gallery but on Boulevard Monmarte, a few steps away from the entrance of the gallery. However, the exit of the museum is inside the Passage, as is the museum shop.
