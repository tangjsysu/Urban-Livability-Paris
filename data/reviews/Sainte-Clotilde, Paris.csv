ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4cjZ5OHh3RRAB,"We came across it while wandering around the city center of Sainte-Clotilde de Paris. On the one hand, what caught our attention about this imposing Catholic church was the children playing in its garden. Since we were in the summer months, the chirping sounds of children playing water games were spreading. Since I was pregnant at that time, we found this very cute. On the other hand, this magnificent building, which suddenly appeared before you while walking between the streets, really added a great identity to the street where it is located. We also liked the fact that small gardens such as rooftops, terraces or small balconies were designed in many suitable areas of the buildings in some streets in the area where the church is located.",a year ago,2024-12-27 20:32:11.705639,5.0,Ãœlke BalcÄ± YeÅŸilkaya,68,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106443939156253091354/reviews?hl=en
