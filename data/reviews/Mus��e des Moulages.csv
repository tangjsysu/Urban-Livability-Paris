The staff were very welcoming and warm and regularly came to ensure that no one was unwell.  We visited the place in 1 hour. As the place is regularly used for meetings (and then closed to the public), it is better to make an appointment to be sure of being able to visit.

What initially appears to be a catalog will become, over the course of the visit, a more human experience. The casts are very realistic, and we sometimes go beyond the medical sphere when reading the cartel. A job, a situation, elements from another time come to us and the imagination is set in motion. It is a journey through time, imbued with empathy and admiration for those who one day agreed to advance science by revealing their affections.
