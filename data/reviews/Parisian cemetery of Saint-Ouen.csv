ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3aHBYeW1nRRAB,"I came this morning, August 15, in the cool of the morning. The doors were open at 8:30 a.m. but I was refused access because entry was delayed until 9 a.m. due to the public holiday. I admit having asked to enter even though I had set foot in the enclosure. The guard made incorrect and disrespectful comments like “I don’t care” What deplorable behavior",4 months ago,2024-12-27 20:03:08.577233,1.0,Michèle Galion,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104893701800622158407/reviews?hl=en-GB

As for the criticisms on. The maintenance and the wild weeds I don't agree, the nature is wild which gives a non-depressing side to this cemetery and that feels good. Watering cans are available, the Lovely staff and for Old people Cars can circulate. Nothing to say, this Cemetery park is the best thing in Paris . We can gather in Peace without having Everything World sticks to us. So only happiness for these moments of misfortune. Thank you to all the cemetery staff and Maintains who Arrives perfectly.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKdTQ3TV9nRRAB,"First of all, very sad that Mr. and Mrs. Thoin closed their establishment. We had been accustomed to them for several generations. Happy retirement, Mr. and Mrs. Thoin. On the other hand, I would like to point out to the cemetery that I am used to caring for several fallen people regularly. You have restricted the water in the fountains. Some fountains work very poorly. Can you repair the fountain which is located in division 9. To get water in a watering can it takes 1 hour. Can you fix this problem? While following the water restriction some fountains are working correctly. Hoping that the cemetery will repair this fountain.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaXR1eVF3EAE,"Yesterday, October 6, in the afternoon, I went to maintain family graves, as I do at least once a year, and I was unpleasantly surprised to find them invaded by wild grass, sometimes reaching a height of fifty. of centimeters, thus demonstrating that the small paths between them are perhaps only weeded for All Saints' Day, not to mention the continual disappearance of artificial flower pots and other objects of homage.
