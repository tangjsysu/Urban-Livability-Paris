ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcXZEU3JnRRAB,"Where to even start‚Ä¶ for phalerists and medal enthusiasts this place is HEAVEN! For history lovers, jewellery nuts and everyone else it is a truly amazing place to marvel at some incredible treasures.  This place is truly the most underrated museum in all of Paris, and my all time favourite in the world. Everyone should spend a few hours wandering the halls of this place. Located in the center of Paris, the museum is located directly opposite the Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay and this means it‚Äôs right on top of the RER station of the same name. It‚Äôs also a two min walk from Metro stop Solf√©rino and a four min walk from Assembl√©e Nationale, both on Metro Line 12. The entry to the museum is free, which is a fantastic perk of like me, you come back multiple times a year. The staff at the front desk are very friendly and assist you with any questions, and there are also toilets in the main reception area.  The museum itself is laid out very well, and easy to navigate. It‚Äôs best to start off with the rooms containing the French orders and decorations. This spans a huge period of time and French history, starting off with the old royal orders from the Ancien Regime. The examples of the Order of Saint Michel, Order of the Holy Spirit and the Order of St Louis are some of the finest in the world and comprise the best collection of these orders anywhere in the planet. Not just insignia but also mantles and robes, as well as documents, cases and other paraphernalia. The French exhibit continues with the greatest collection on the planet of the museums namesake; the Legion d‚ÄôHonneur. The quality and variety of the sets of insignia on display will blow you alway‚Ä¶ tones of examples from the Napoleonic First Empire, through the Bourbon Restoration, July Monarchy, Second Republic, Second Empire and finally the 3rd, 4th and current 5th republic. Showing the slight and sometimes radical alterations made to the design of the order, there are examples from every grade and every period. The highlight of the Legion d‚ÄôHonneur section is the three collars on display, the Napoleonic collar, the collar from the third republic and the collar of the current French state, still used at presidential inaugurations today.  The next part of the museum deals with orders and decorations from around the world, starting off with the rest of Europe. The selection of insignia on display is beyond world-class. It is simply the greatest collection ever compiled, both in quality and quantity. Sets of insignia almost impossible to see on display anywhere else on earth, as well as examples from very famous individuals. Almost every European country, both big and small and from different eras of their history are displayed. Stunningly rare items from the German and Italian states, as well as British Orders of the Garter, Habsburg Orders of the Fleece, Swedish Order of the Seraphim and Danish Order of the Elephant, are displayed beautifully and in such quantities and quality that it takes your breath away. Towards the end of the international hall you can see items from Asian, Middle Eastern, African and American counties with some very rare articles on display as well.  Upstairs deals with mostly either military medals, or individuals collections that have been kept and displayed together. Full of examples of some of the rarest and most beautiful orders and decorations, it‚Äôs truly breathtaking. The artistry and craft of these pieces, as well as in some cases the value of precious stones and diamonds, not to even mention the rarity, mean that anyone even slightly interested in these objects, don‚Äôt find a better collection anywhere else. You will find you have spent hours just admiring these beautiful objects and learning their history and meaning.  If you are a collector yourself, it‚Äôs very fun to see items on display that you have in your personal collection, as well as items you‚Äôve always dreamed of owning. If you are very interested, I recommend visiting on the 18th September each year, as this is a government open day in Paris and you can visit the chancellery as well!",2 years ago,2024-12-28 15:59:59.028153,5.0,Alex Bransby,279,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110306525668479416594/reviews?hl=en-GB
