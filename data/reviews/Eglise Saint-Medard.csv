ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3Z1pfcDh3RRAB,"The church of Saint Medard is a Catholic place of worship in Paris, located on rue Mouffetard, on the left bank of the Seine, south-east of the Sainte-Geneviève mountain. Built between the 15th and 18th centuries, it is home to the parish of the same name which includes a part of the 5th arrondissement, where the church stands, as well as a part of the 13th. Since the law of separation of Churches from State of 1905, it has been the property of the Municipality of Paris. The church of Saint Medard was built in the neighborhood which, until the Revolution, was called Faubourg Saint-Marceau and in which numerous churches once located nearby disappeared during the Revolution and with the transformation of Paris under the Second Empire. The plan of the church reflects its history with three homogeneous complexes dated respectively to the mid-15th century, to the period 1562-1620 and to the 18th century, the oldest parts being located at the level of the western facade and the adjacent bays and the most modern ones at the level of the apse. The exterior of the church was cleared of houses in the years 1868-1869. Starting from the first three bays of the Flamboyant Gothic nave from the end of the 15th century, we discover a choir that was enlarged in the 16th century, remodeled in the 17th and 18th centuries and covered with a wooden vault, unique in Paris, which was originally temporary but which is still in place today. The nave is adorned with five keystones with images. The alterations are particularly evident at the level of the capitals illustrating the Gothic, the Renaissance and the Classical.",5 months ago,2025-02-09 15:20:16.311915,5.0,daniele pedroni,"1,719",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106356302369543242970/reviews?hl=en
