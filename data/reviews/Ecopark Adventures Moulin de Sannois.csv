ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4dDd6VkdBEAE,"This was my first visit every to any type of park like this one and i am from Canada. They have 12 different levels. They gave very detailed explanations to have as much fun. I do suggest you go with long pants rather than shorts to prevent scruffs and probably gloves. It makes holding the ropes much more comfortable. Although it was a hot day, i did not feel the heat much as there were plenty of trees around. The staff were very courteous/ Nice and helpful. I do find there should be a bit more staff within the parkour for safety purposes. I plan on going back next time i go back to Paris to face my fears.",4 years ago,2024-12-27 19:39:14.080787,5.0,Mary B,96,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115702983687142636265/reviews?hl=en-GB
