This is a bronze statue of a male lion rising up on his front legs with full mane on display. Showcased by Bartholdi in 1878 before being purchased by the city of Paris and suitably placed at this square which is named after Colonel Denfert-Rochereau, the commander who led the French defence during the siege of Belfort (1870-71).

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzak9TOTBBRRAB,"The Lion of Belfort is a colossal statue created by the French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi and located in the city of Belfort, France. It commemorates the city's heroic resistance during the Prussian siege of 1870. 22 meters long and 11 meters high, the work is made up of blocks of pink Pérouse sandstone sculpted one by one and transported under the Belfort citadel to be assembled. Originally it was supposed to face Germany, but after protests from the latter it was decided to face it west. Bartholdi would have used the lion Brutus of the tamer Jean-Baptiste Pezon as a model for his work. Construction began in 1872 and was completed in September 1879. Due to disputes between the city and the sculptor there was no official inauguration at the time but Bartholdi still managed to organize, with the support of the citizens, an ""unofficial "" and on 28 August 1880 he covered the expenses for an illumination of the work. On 20 April 1930 the statue was classified as a historical monument and in 1989 it was officially inaugurated by Jean-Pierre Chevènement. A version of the Peugeot logo may have its origins in the Lion of Belfort. This logo is inspired, in fact, by the lion present in the flag of Franche-Comté (the Peugeot family originally came from these areas) and was originally intended to symbolize the three qualities of the Peugeot company, strength, flexibility and speed.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 12:28:48.790552,4.0,daniele pedroni,"1,726",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106356302369543242970/reviews?hl=en
