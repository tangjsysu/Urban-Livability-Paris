ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdXNIWXhnRRAB,The original meter stick. Not so obvious to see but it has a lot of meanings behind it. Recommend “Measure of All Things” by Ken Alder.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdWVDS1N3EAE,"Five stars for its very existence, but today (early February, 2020), the object is covered up and inside a construction site. I asked the guys working there if I could see it anyway, and they said, non, quelle dommage, impossible. I tried being really pathetic, came from California to see this, no dice. We should be done by end of the month, maybe, one said. Or April, said another. Come back! Anyway, if you think the meter is a cool thing, read “The Measure of All Things,” a dynamite history of the two French surveyors who determined its length. Or did they? The story is full of courage, persistence, ingenuity, war, and madness. And the first international scientific conference. And why the USA does not use the metric system.
