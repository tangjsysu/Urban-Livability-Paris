ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3cF8yTU1BEAE,"Whenever I go to a new town, city or area, I always go to a church. Whether you're religious or not, it's always nice to go to a place of worship to take a break from the hustle and bustle of life, to take stock of life and be still.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1bE9YYkJ3EAE,A church for parishioners and serious religious students. Its beauty shines in the quiet light of introspection. Few tourists stray far enough from the Seine to find it. A rare example of building caught between the move from Roman architecture to early Gothic.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvbmZLY01REAE,"Saint-Merri (Eglise Saint Merri) is a 16th-century church, Flamboyant Gothic in architectural style along Rue de la Verrerie just a couple blocks south of Centre Pompidou in the Right Bank.  The exterior of the church is nice to view if you are a fan of Gothic architecture. The interior features an expectedly narrow and very  attractive nave with high vaulted ceiling. The main altarpiece - a sculpture of Christ being crucified is impressive, as are the stained-glass windows and18th-century carved pulpit. The aisle and side chapels provide more religious items and wall frescos to view within the church.  Interestingly, the church was hosting a contemporary art exhibition of sorts when we visited in December, showcasing some intriguing works of art that were at times as interesting to view as the interior of the church.  We enjoyed our brief visit to the Church of Saint-Merri and would gladly revisit while sightseeing around Le Marias in the future.",5 years ago,2024-12-27 20:12:22.501787,4.0,Brad,"5,430",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB
