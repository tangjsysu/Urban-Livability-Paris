ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIeDltYW1BRRAB,"Slightly wooded, it is more of a pedestrian space than a garden. Originally the Port Garden of the Town Hall, this space was redeveloped in 2017. Part of the vast ensemble of the Rives de Seine park by participating in the continuity of the route along the river, it offers a view of the islands and fun activities. Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, born in 1898 in Fuente Vaqueros, near Granada, is a man of letters, painter and musician. At a very young age, he became involved with the artistic avant-gardes of Madrid. His poetic collection Romancero Gitano, published in 1928, exalts sensuality and the desire for freedom, both in the literary form and in the political sense. Between 1931 and 1936, under the Republic, he directed the troupe La Barraca, which played in the rural provinces. During this period he wrote his dramatic trilogy Blood Wedding, Verma and The House of Bernarda Alba. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, he was threatened because of his republican beliefs and his homosexuality. Arrested by Franco's troops on August 19, 1936, he was assassinated on the side of a road near V√≠znar (Andalusia).",4 months ago,2025-02-09 14:57:57.684770,3.0,Laurent Padou,851,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102878442016850755868/reviews?hl=en-US
