ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzeDUzcmFREAE,"Absolutely beautiful hotel and museum, especially the Borghese special exposition. However, the security guard was unbelievably rude and condescending for absolutely no reason. I had a ticket scheduled for 10am in my Apple Wallet: he first didn't seem to believe me and said my ticket was for 17h (?), then made me show him it via email while taunting me and questioning its validity - and I speak french! Perhaps he just wanted to be rude to somebody and chose me since I was alone and the only young person going to the exposition at that time, but it is really mind-boggling to see. Funny thing is he only calmed down when I calmly said that he wasn't being very gentle! Sad that this seems to be the away it works in France sometimes, got to be rude back so they don't overpower you.",a month ago,2024-12-28 15:46:55.069442,2.0,João Betti,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113431002189853237451/reviews?hl=en-GB
