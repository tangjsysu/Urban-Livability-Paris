ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQMXVLSEF3EAE,"A free-to-attend Breitling pop-up museum lies at the heart of Zurich, just minutes from the main boutique. It showcases a wide variety of models spanning Breitling‚Äôs three ‚Äòrealms‚Äô: air, land, and sea. You‚Äôll even find models worn by the Breitling family themselves, as well as pieces famously sported by Richard Branson.  Philip was very welcoming, assisting with registration, providing an overview of the models on display, and sharing a brief history of the brand.  Additionally, there‚Äôs a rare opportunity to purchase Breitling merchandise that‚Äôs typically unavailable in boutiques or authorized dealers.
