The Luxor obelisk is one of two that were erected in front of the temple in Thebes (Luxor), Egypt, more than 3,000 years ago during the reign of King Ramesses II. One of the remains is said to still be in front of the Luxor Temple.  There are many cases in which European countries stole cultural artifacts from their colonies during the era of colonial empires and made them their own, but this obelisk is not one of those things; it was a gift from the Egyptian government to France in the 19th century. It seems that it was made. It is approximately 23 meters high and can be seen for free if you go to Place de la Concorde.  The surface is engraved with hieroglyphic inscriptions that anyone can read, whether or not they understand the meaning. In hieroglyphics, there is a grammar that encloses the king's name in a round symbol, and this obelisk also has multiple descriptions surrounded by this symbol, so we can imagine that the names of the kings who founded the temple are written there. .",5 months ago,2025-01-24 12:33:40.418122,5.0,gk “Izumrud” Izmo,715,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116822099528776565745/reviews?hl=en
