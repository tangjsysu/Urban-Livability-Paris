ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfc3U2RzVBRRAB,"Cool museum focused on technological innovation and engineering sciences. Really enjoyed the presentation of scientific instruments over the years. The main focus, however, is the converted church which holds the Foucault pendulum and various machines over three levels. Great little outing, with some interactive elements, although for a science museum the staff did not particularly foster an environment for awe, discovery and discussions as they regularly requested for silence.",2 months ago,2025-03-15 22:24:01.191444,5.0,Pascal MORIMANNO,42,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114711545170948226101/reviews?hl=en-US

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIcU9LTER3EAE,"The museum's treasures trace the history of technology since the 16th century in seven areas: scientific instruments, materials, construction, communication, energy, mechanics and transport. The former abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs serves as a showcase for the collections, presented chronologically. Visitors will discover a charming automaton from 1784, La Joueuse de tympanon, the unmissable Foucault Pendulum (1851) and an aeroplane from 1897. The visit ends... in the Arts et Métiers metro station, inspired by Jules Verne's Nautilus. A lot of things to see and understand. I hope you love to see how things work and the machinery involved in it. This was a treat for me as I loved to see the Lumière brothers' camera, the first plane to take off or the ancestor of the automobile dating from the reign of Louis XV, the greatest inventions, those which have revolutionized our civilization, can be found at the Museum of Arts and Crafts.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyeDRPbVNREAE,"This is a truly amazing collection of historical technological items; budget at least 3 hours if you want to read signs and learn how some of the items work. The visual display is done very well. But — the audio guide was INCREDIBLY painful. In the English version it was extremely sexist; I felt like I was being mansplained to for most audio clips. There was a female voice asking curious questions and exclaiming in amazement, and the male voice was giving all of the information, explaining the items to her.  Another problem is that there were very few child audio guide items.  We were looking around for audio numbers for my seven year-old, and there were some rooms with none, and some very famous big items with no child friendly commentary.  Furthermore, the numbers for the adult and child guides were very often not in front of the actual objects the audio guide was talking about. I had to look around the display case and pay attention to clues from the audio guide as to how the object was supposed to look in order to find the thing we were talking about. Finally, the audio guide referenced other items in the room for comparison, and it was impossible to find those items based on the location or description. My guess is that the audio guide is very old, items have been moved around since it was created, and gender awareness was not as much of a concern in STEM as it is now.",8 months ago,2025-03-15 22:24:01.200118,4.0,Rebecca Allen,33,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111944301837611085514/reviews?hl=en

Without the audio guide, most explanations are only in French, which is very unfriendly for tourists.  Additionally, the museum prefers quantity over quality, so you end up walking through a lot of uninteresting exhibits without much context.
