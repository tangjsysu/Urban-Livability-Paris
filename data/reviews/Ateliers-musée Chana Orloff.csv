ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNneGV5d013EAE,"An extraordinary artist, creator and sculptress, Chana Orloff blew my socks off!  She hung with Zadkine and Modigliani and yet she isn’t as famous as them.  Frankly she touches my soul in a way they cannot.  She uses so many mediums and it is clear she is a mother and woman.  She captures both so beautifully!  What a treasure her atelier is!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfdmZxS1ZnEAE,"Villa Seurat is a cul-de-sac that is worth a walk. As for the Chana Orloff workshop-museum, visited with one of her grandsons as a guide, it is a very beautiful and moving experience. We feel the presence of this strong woman with an incredible destiny and whose gentle, sometimes funny and always very powerful works welcome you warmly. You would almost expect to hear Ms. Orloff coming down the stairs from the apartment above to tell you about this client wanting a sculpture of her dachshund and sending her driver to harass the great artist almost every day.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqajlfaC1nRRAB,"I love the fabulous studio of Chana Orloff, an exceptional artist whose work continues to captivate and inspire me. Located in a setting that exudes history and creativity, this workshop-museum is a true hidden treasure. The visit, narrated by her grandson, offers an intimate and enriching perspective on the life and work of Chana Orloff. Very informed and passionate, he shares not only family anecdotes but also the importance of his grandmother's art in the contemporary world. This unique experience is a fascinating immersion into the legacy of an artist who marked her time. Don't miss the opportunity to delve into the world of Chana Orloff, where each sculpture and each space tells a story of artistic passion and family devotion.

The place is magnificent but in the faint glow of the playful lamp but not very suitable because given the flowering of the sculptures I did not feel the enhancement of the works which were rather stored without any real little notice or card mentioning the name, date etc... computer boxes under the works, it’s a shame because they’re neglected. Sorry, I imagine that the heirs are doing their best but no small document or frieze mentioning the pivotal dates of this great Artist.
