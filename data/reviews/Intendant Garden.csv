ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeWVHcWJREAE,"A nice, well-kept garden even in the cold winters of January. Unfortunately a bit too cold to run around and explore it some more, but it looks like a good place to relax before/after the Army Museum.",2 years ago,2025-01-24 11:36:58.777956,5.0,Lucian Marin,446,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115456628886222260247/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWcmZHTjZRRRAB,"The garden was created in 1980 according to plans by Robert de C√¥te drawn up in the 17th century. It follows the French style with tangled lawns and manicured shrubs. This garden is in harmony with the Church of Invalides. The sumptuous embroidery of the ‚ÄúFrench-style‚Äù flower beds enhances the architecture of the building built by Bruant and Jules Hardouin-Mansart‚Äôs ‚Äúdome,‚Äù which houses Napoleon‚Äôs famous tomb. A statue made by Ernest Dubois in the 19th century pays tribute to Mansart. You'll find French garden classics ""yews cut into a conical shape, lawns lined with boxwoods, and flower beds in geometric shapes.""",a year ago,2025-01-24 11:36:58.782963,4.0,Mohammad Ayoub,230,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102613109672441235778/reviews?hl=en-GB
