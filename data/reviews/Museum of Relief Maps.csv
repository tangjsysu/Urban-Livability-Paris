ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUMjVUS0FnEAE,"A museum contained inside the hotel de Invalides, showing relief maps of military importance throughout the 1700s. These are essentially large table sized models of towns and the castles. Many coastal French towns needed to defend themselves against the English and Dutch Navies, so Islands points and river mouths were defended with Forts, and mapped out in models, so that the generals in Paris could strategize.",7 months ago,2024-12-28 16:01:04.038229,4.0,Derek Kerton,168,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107761297884639198094/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoaXNEeERBEAE,Take a hike on the fourth floor of the French army museum. You will find some highly interesting things related to strategic models of quite a few fortresses and cities. With a bit of assistance the wheelchair was no problem and there is some interactivity for a younger audience. In the same complex you will find Napoleon's tomb as well as Vauban's and Turenne's. Excellent giftshop and very friendly people offering coffee etc.,a year ago,2024-12-28 16:01:04.038229,4.0,Jacobus Hubertus Kirchner,74,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100242260243074337325/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNFdkxyeG9RRRAB,"""Find me,"" my wife said, ""a small, quirky museum."" I succeed. Ignoring the other rooms on our ascent of the stairs, we arrived at the Plans-Reliefs and it was everything I'd hoped. Dark, detailed, beautifully designed and minimal (in terms of the exhibit enclosures), and almost completely deserted. I think there was one other couple in there the whole time we looked, enthralled, at these exquisite models. They were designed and realized to leave no detail un-noted, because their defensive purpose required it. There is a sense in these reliefs of how life was actually lived in the 18th and 19th century in rural and urban France. With detailing at the level of hedgerows and farmhouses, one could move around the exhibits and imagine people moving through the landscape. It was a lovely moment of quiet and contemplation during a really delightful visit to Paris. I should note that my wife is an architect, and I share her fascination and enthusiasm for perfectly detailed models, so this choice was perfect for us. Not everyone may find this attention to detail in a calm quiet setting as gripping as we did, but for those who might, I cannot recommend this wonderful museum highly enough.",4 years ago,2024-12-28 16:01:04.040230,5.0,Julian Halliday,15,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112102851264817091224/reviews?hl=en
