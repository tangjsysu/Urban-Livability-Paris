The staff is friendly and welcoming, enhancing the overall experience.

Second thing to mention is the list of marines species we have seen, this experience was more about for my little cousins as I have not seen them for awhile while. They were very happy, I can not tell enough how happy I was too to be able to enjoy day out with them and all was great. They didn’t want to leave and if it wasn’t for them being tired by themselves then we would have sleep in that aquarium  :)•• My partner, their mum and myself was amazed and loved it too. I couldn’t asked for less❤️ Ticket cost was over 100€ for a family of 7 :)  And last part of the experience is that, I would personally like to give an award to RIYAD because without him we wouldn’t have been able to experience all of this in the way it went, we were first of all lost and didn’t know what we were doing and where exactly to go to see the different marine species, he provided us with guidance and to make our life better he did this in English even though I speak French but because my partner would understand easily. To conclude I would give all credits to him for  this memorable experience we have had.
