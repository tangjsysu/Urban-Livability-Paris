ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrdTZIaTBnRRAB,"Growing up near this place, I have to say that this church has a nice history and that Don Bosco was the patron saint of education. It is a nice place to seek spiritual refuge and the stained glass windows are very nice. A guided tour is given every month. The staff of the church are also very responsive by phone and I advise anyone seeking information to contact them since they even called me back when I left a voice message. Their website is also very helpful.",4 years ago,2025-02-09 15:15:41.399174,5.0,Alexandre Samy,53,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107354887878382232274/reviews?hl=en-US

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKNjdfTDB3RRAB,"The Don Bosco church, located in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, is a true architectural gem. Its modern and daring style contrasts with the traditional architecture of Parisian churches. Its design is a harmony of geometric shapes, from which a large illuminated cross emerges, symbolizing faith and hope. The interior is just as impressive with a celestial vault evoking a starry sky, offering a contemplative and serene atmosphere. The large stained glass window, with its color variations, breathes a soft and soothing luminosity. The Don Bosco Church is therefore a perfect example of how contemporary architecture can give a new dimension to religious spaces, making them both welcoming and inspiring.",a year ago,2025-02-09 15:15:41.404174,5.0,Angenic Paris Par Rues Méconnues,73,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106983798493346557472/reviews?hl=en
