ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfaDlYRE5BEAE,"Even though we’ve been to Paris, this spot out in the Bois du Boulogne seemed far to us. Today, we got there in 2 easy trains and a short walk. What a glorious building! Worth the trip alone, but also a huge Pop Art exhibit, an outdoor terrace and a delightful cafe gave us an afternoon to remember. All of te staff was friendly and helpful.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmMGVTSzVRRRAB,"A Masterpiece of Contemporary Architecture  The Louis Vuitton Foundation is an absolute dream for architects and design enthusiasts. Designed by Frank Gehry, the building itself is a work of art—an incredible fusion of bold imagination and engineering precision. Its sail-like glass panels, floating above the lush greenery of the Bois de Boulogne, create a structure that feels both monumental and weightless.  Walking through the space is an immersive experience. The interplay of natural light and shadows is mesmerizing, with every angle offering a new perspective. Gehry’s mastery of form and material is on full display—each curve, angle, and surface seems to echo the movement of water or air. The way the structure engages with its surroundings, especially the reflection of its glass panels in the nearby water features, adds a dynamic layer to the design.  Inside, the galleries are spacious and beautifully integrated with the architecture. The flowing layout guides visitors through the exhibits while maintaining a strong connection to the outdoors through expansive views. The rooftop terraces are a highlight, offering spectacular panoramas of Paris while showcasing the intricate details of the building’s construction.  The Louis Vuitton Foundation is not just a cultural institution—it’s a celebration of what architecture can achieve. It seamlessly blends art, design, and nature into an unforgettable experience. If you’re an architect visiting Paris, this is a must-see. It will leave you inspired and in awe of Gehry’s genius.",2 months ago,2025-03-15 23:17:18.378537,5.0,Elmira Esfahani,88,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101988448575446914234/reviews?hl=en-US

The current exhibition, primarily focusing on Tom Wesselmann, showcases a diverse range of works, from dioramas of a bygone era to sketches of the female form. While the exhibition was generally enjoyable, Wesselmann’s art crosses a line into the realm of pornography.

Good ol Fran Gehry did it again… at the time I visited the Pop Art expo centered on Tom Wesselman was on, with a good mix of other artists tangencial to the genre, modern and contemporary from the west and some from the east and Africa.  Some details. Better to buy tickets online to avoid lines. There are bathrooms in every floor dont waste your time making a line in the cloakroom bathroom.  Visit the giftshop first, it gets busy when you finish the visit.  The bus 63 is nor working for a while and the info in google maps os not good. Go by Metro!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzZzlEYmtRRRAB,"I recently visited the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris on November 10 at 1:10 pm, and while the building itself is an architectural marvel, my experience was completely ruined by the unprofessionalism of the security guard. I was forced to put my expensive camera and Louis Vuitton bag in a box at the entrance, and the guard handled them with absolutely no care. It was so upsetting to see my belongings tossed aside like that, especially when they're supposed to be protecting them. This completely ruined my mood for the rest of my visit. I subsequently contacted the Louis Vuitton Foundation via email to express my disappointment. Unfortunately, their response was dismissive and lacked empathy. They defended their security protocols, offering no apology or acknowledgment of the negative impact on my visit. It's disheartening to see such a prestigious institution treat its visitors with such disregard.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURidUw2ZEtREAE,"The Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris may not be worth your time if you've already visited the MoMA. The museum's offerings do not live up to the Louis Vuitton name. The highlight of this Frank Gehry-designed building is arguably the 360-degree view available on Google Maps. If you are familiar with Gehry's other works, this one does not stand out, and the interior design is confusing and impractical.  Inside, the museum is divided into many small rooms and nooks, making navigation difficult and disorienting. The excessive use of corners and fragmented windows adds to the confusion, and the inefficient use of space limits the area available for displaying art. This layout can be particularly challenging for those with mobility issues.  The on-site restaurant is adequate but not compelling enough to justify a visit. The current exhibitions, including those on Matisse, Ellsworth Kelly, and a sports-themed exhibit related to the Olympics, are underwhelming and fail to deliver the grandeur promised.  In summary, the Fondation Louis Vuitton does not offer enough to make it a must-see,  Ps Who decide  to do a Matisse exhibition with multiple pieces coming from the MoMa NYC while the city attract so many American and New Yorkers during the Olympics ?  the Pinault Foundation vault has a much better collection and curates better exhibitions.",7 months ago,2025-03-15 23:17:27.037764,2.0,Damien Frennet,267,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108486466591582514114/reviews?hl=en
