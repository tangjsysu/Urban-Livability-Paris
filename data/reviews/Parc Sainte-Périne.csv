ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBd2NUZURnEAE,"Awesome park. The main reason we chose our apartment was to be close to it. It has two separate playground areas for kids of different age, one of which subdivides in two for older ages. A huge grass area for picnic, sitting, playing, a modest sport arena in the form of amphitheater, a small separate oval track with soft inclinations where kids can skate, scoot or play with remote controlled vehicles, and yet another separate area for playing with dogs and pets. Easy access from both Mirabeau and Versailles and a nice stone trail around it, including benches on the highest part of the hill that provide a lovely full view of the park.",8 years ago,2025-01-24 13:43:02.760410,5.0,Carlos Miranda Levy,98,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117198457070769240232/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3dG9POEx3EAE,"Public park nestled between buildings, sheltered away from the surrounding roads. Large sloping grassed area surrounded by trees and overlooked by the Sainte-Périne geriatric hospital. There are some small decorative gardens. The lawns are open for use including for ball games and picnicking. A gravelled amphitheatre is also popular for ball games. Children's play areas include a sandpit, climbing frames and riding toys for three separate age groups. The paved bike circuit is typically used by young cyclists, skaters and scooters. Dogs on leashes are allowed in certain areas and there is an informal off-leash dog play area. There are several picnic tables and fixed seating scattered around the park. Water fountains are available most of the year (as is the norm with most Parisian parks, water fountains are turned off during winter). Public toilets are outside the rue Mirabeau entrance. There is a park warden. A very popular destination for local families. Not recommended for jogging as to complete a circuit, you must pass through several small swinging gates. Venue for annual summer ball, as organised by the local council (Mairie du 16émé).",8 years ago,2025-01-24 13:43:02.764052,5.0,DG,11,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106928446511460436105/reviews?hl=en
