ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURucnNPR0FnEAE,"This is a peculiar sculpture outside of Gare du Nord. It is the work of sculptor Richard Texier and was installed in 2015. What you see is a 7 metre tall see-through creature, supposed to be a polar bear with wings.  The figure aims to introduce awareness of the problems with climate change, invoking a contemporary interpretation of polar bears being stuck on floating ice packs. Not sure if those passing by will naturally come to this perspective viewing the sculpture but it is interesting to see regardless.",3 months ago,2025-01-24 11:43:33.528003,3.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB

Commissioned by the SNCF as part of the Climate Conference, COP21, the 7.5 meter high silhouette seems to disintegrate under the influence of a mysterious illness , global warming. Conceptual and plastic, the silent cry of the bronze animal calls out to passers-by to make them aware of the urgency to act.
