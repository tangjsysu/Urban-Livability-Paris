ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPN0xpT2tBRRAB,"We joined Mitch for the morning historical tour and then again in the evening for the food/ wine tour- he did not disappoint! Mitch is fluent in 4 languages and knows the answers to all questions asked! We were only in Paris for two days, and this was a great way to see all the city in one day. Definitely recommend! Not too much walking but enough that you feel good.",2 years ago,2025-01-24 11:42:05.424450,5.0,Cassandra Dahms,21,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103606531984159567768/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlX3BxZUxnEAE,"My Fiance and I had a wonderful walking tour with Elle. It was a nice small group - 6 of us plus Elle for the walking tour. Elle was VERY knowledgable of the sights in Paris and could answer almost any question we had while on the walking tour. We had a WONDERFUL wine and cheese tasting at Cave du Pyranees and all of us had such a great time. We also got to learn about the Falafal wars (LOL) and had some delicious macaroons and tried pastries I'd never even heard of! Even though we went over our time, Elle was still willing to show us the Jewish Quarters at her own expense. Highly recommend this walking tour to anyone new to Paris who wants to get to know the city, its history, its culture, and more. Thanks Elle! Patty and I had such a great time on your tour!!",2 years ago,2025-01-24 11:42:05.426450,5.0,Christopher Schultz,26,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109001032667844268205/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwMVkySHBnRRAB,"I was on a New York Times tour of the Left bank with Emilie, and it was an excellent experience! Emilie is a great guide, a charming Parisienne with a very pleasant voice and manner. She provided a great balance of historical facts and local knowledge. It was my 6th time in the city, and still I discovered a lot of new things for myself at the tour. The stops and the route are quite extraordinary, off the beaten track, and there are some nice surprises for the guests along the way. Overall, a fascinating and unique experience well worth the price!",5 years ago,2025-01-24 11:42:05.428449,5.0,Polina Kosheleva,7,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104362944480929782274/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNna0tfQkVnEAE,"I am not someone who usually takes guided tours while on vacation, often preferring to discover things on my own, but Paris Urban Adventures has made me reconsider this approach.  I have been to Paris on multiple occasions, but this time, I wanted to try and discover something new, something different.  I decided to take the Bohemian Paris tour on the spur of the moment, and I am very glad I did. Besides seeing a different side of Paris than I had in the past, the guide, Tim, was extremely friendly, funny, and most importantly knowledgable about the area.  It is amazing to me how much history is there if you just know where to look, and Tim did an amazing job pointing us in the right direction.  I would recommend this tour to anyone looking for a different side of the city!",7 years ago,2025-01-24 11:42:05.429450,5.0,George Allen,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107734476082597441886/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnNnVtT2h3RRAB,"My boyfriend and I spent the day with Arthur in Paris on a full day ""how to be a Parisian Tour""  We agree that is was the highlight of our trip and our favorite day!  The tour is broad ranging in terms of history, stories, ""secrets"" of the city and great food.  Arthur was the perfect guide and was helpful in reccomending some dinner spots for later in the week.  If you are on the fence about this tour at all, we can't reccomend it enough.  It's worth every penny you spend, in fact we wish we had signed up for a few more.",7 years ago,2025-01-24 11:42:05.431450,5.0,Ellen Konkle,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105111494932171653340/reviews?hl=en

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncy02ajB3RRAB,"If you're into beer and local bars and bistrots the Bastile Bites Tour is definetly the right thing for you. We'd recommend it especially for the beginning of your trip, cause you learn about the history of paris and get insidertips (if you ask). Also you have the chance to try out some special beers in an authentic atmosphere.
