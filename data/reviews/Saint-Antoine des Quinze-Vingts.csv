ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsdTVXbTVBRRAB,"My visit to the Saint-Antoine des Quinze Vingts Church in Paris was a truly enriching experience! This Roman Catholic church, located at 66 Avenue Ledru Rollin in the 12th arrondissement of Paris, is a true architectural gem.  The Saint-Antoine des Quinze Vingts Church is built of brick and stone according to a basilical plan in the neo-Romanesque style. Its design is both elegant and imposing, and the interior is equally impressive. I was captivated by the details of the sculptures and stained glass windows, which add a touch of beauty and spirituality to this sacred place.  The atmosphere of the church is one of calm and serenity. Walking through its alleys, I felt a deep inner peace. It is a place where you can gather, meditate and connect to your spirituality.  In addition, the Saint-Antoine des Quinze Vingts Church offers regular religious services. If you have the opportunity to attend a mass, I highly recommend it. It is a unique spiritual experience that will allow you to immerse yourself in the fervor of the local Catholic community.  In conclusion, my visit to the √âglise Saint-Antoine des Quinze Vingts in Paris was a memorable experience. I left with a deep admiration for this place of worship and a feeling of inner peace. üôè‚ú®üòä",9 months ago,2024-12-27 20:21:33.196883,5.0,Clara VideoStudio,115,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110546395336245365268/reviews?hl=en
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURObGVfbUpBEAE,"Located between avenue Ledru-Rollin and rue Traversi√®re, the church takes its name from two religious establishments in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which have now disappeared. First, the Cistercian abbey of Saint-Antoine-des-Champs founded in the 12th century outside the walls of Paris and occupied, from 1795, by the current Saint-Antoine hospital. Then, the hospice for the blind of the Quinze- Twenty ¬†founded by King Saint Louis at the beginning of the 13th century in the Faubourg Saint-Honor√©, then transferred in 1780 in the disused barracks of the Black Musketeers, current site of the National Ophthalmology Hospital Center.  In 1898, thanks to the generosity of the faithful, Father Rivi√®re purchased the current site: a long trapezoidal plot. The architect Lucien Roy (1850-1941) built the church to the plans of √âmile Vaudreme, his master, between 1902 and 1904.",11 months ago,2024-12-27 20:21:33.197883,4.0,L Si Saber,731,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106226479501007635577/reviews?hl=en
