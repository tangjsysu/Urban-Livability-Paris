ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzX29UY1B3EAE,"Picasso Museum, Paris  I loved visiting the Picasso Museum in Paris! Located in the charming Marais district, this museum is in a beautiful historic building and holds over 5,000 artworksâ€”paintings, sculptures, and drawings. Itâ€™s fascinating to see how Picassoâ€™s art evolved through different stages of his life.  Iâ€™ve also been to the Picasso Museum in Barcelona, and both are very different in a great way. The Paris museum showcases his entire career, while Barcelona focuses on his early works. Each collection is unique and complements the other beautifully!  Tips for Your Visit: Book tickets online: It saves time and avoids long lines. Arrive early: Mornings are less crowded. Use the audio guide: It explains the art and Picassoâ€™s life really well. Take your time: Plan for about 2-3 hours to fully enjoy the museum. Check for special exhibits: They often have unique displays. Explore the courtyard: Itâ€™s a peaceful spot for photos. Visit the cafÃ©: A great place for a coffee break. Shop for souvenirs: The gift shop has art books, postcards, and more. This museum is a must-see in Paris, even if youâ€™ve been to the one in Barcelona. Itâ€™s an unforgettable experience!",a month ago,2024-12-27 21:41:24.869174,5.0,Fran Benedito,42,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111785051509413171810/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMMHFiNkhnEAE,"Despite this museum housing some 5,000 works by one of the most well known artists to have lived, I would say it is one of the lesser known museums in Paris. Most people visit the Lourve, Dâ€™Orsay etc, but for the money and quality of the collection I would come here again any day. The museum itself is somewhat difficult to access as despite it being a substantial building the entrance is tucked around a back street without much signage. The collection itself is composed of mostly paintings but also some wonderful sculptures (including superb chandeliers) along with prints and other works on paper. It is very well curated with extensive explanatory texts and full of unexpected delights. It also has good baby changing facilities which are an unfortunate rarity in Paris.

This museum does a really good job in making the rooms fit exactly with what you see in the painting. For example, his blue period and the time he used a lot of colored stripes are both combined combined with rooms in the same colors and style. In this way, you really see the connection between his work. The 5 floors aren't really big, which makes it a great museum to visit for a maximum of 1,5 hours.
