ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIc0pmaThnRRAB,"The Louvre semi private tour we had last week with Emily was fantastic.  All was seamless and she communicated very well so there were no questions around logistics on the day of the tour. Emily was present exactly when she said she would be and had earpieces for everyone so we could hear her speaking throughout the tour.  We went on the tour with 2 other couples for a total of six and although we have been to the Louvre 2 other times, Emily's knowledge and passion for art made it all that much better.  We saw the most popular works that many would expect in addition to many others that we saw but didn't know the history. Emily pointed out a number of things that we had never even knew. Emily is very well spoken and being an artist herself makes all that she shared more impactful. I would highly recommend this tour and Emily.",3 months ago,2024-12-28 16:31:34.492963,5.0,George Zaharchak,43,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114660059816100963712/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNydXZpLUFREAE,"This is our second trip to Paris. We didn't do it Louvre last year because it's SERIOUSLY overwhelming. It's massive and we don't know what we're doing. We decided we couldn't come to Paris a second time without doing the Louvre, so we decided to get help and booked a guided tour. My expectations were still low and assumed the kids would be miserable, but we could cross it off the bucket list. I was wrong.  Our tour guide, Paloma, has a PhD in Medieval Art History and clearly has some experience with keeping kids engaged because both of my kids (10 and 16) were with her the ENTIRE 3.5 hours.  There's no way we'd have gotten the same level of context out of a random visit to the Louvre, reading the little descriptions ourselves. I'm SO glad we did this.
