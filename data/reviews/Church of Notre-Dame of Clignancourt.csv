Just at the entrance, on the side of the old baptistery, the floor is dirty, there are traces of dust and plaster. The curtain which hides the frescoes are filled with wax... The statues are also dirty, We can see this because people touch the statues and they change color. Maybe the manager is overwhelmed? Or too old? Could we call on volunteers?
