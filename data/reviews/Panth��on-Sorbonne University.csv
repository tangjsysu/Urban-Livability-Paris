ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3d2ZYN3B3RRAB,"They sell the ""Sorbonne"" brand name and the reputation of the old (non-existent since 1970) University of Paris. Misleading and deceptive marketing; no actual substance. It's easy to be admitted and it's very easy to graduate with high marks, but you don't learn much... At M2 level, students were frequently absent/missing classes, and still they faced no consequences and this wasn't reflected on their grades. In other (more serious) universities/grandes écoles, these truant students wouldn't have been admitted to the exams and would have never graduated. Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne has lax standards; it's an easy university. At least, the staff of Paris I isn't as bad as their colleagues at the University of Paris II Panthéon-Assas and the infamous Manuel M. de A.* (""le maître"" of cover-ups).  *I don't mention his surname (I write only the initials, so as to comply with Google's terms of service).",4 months ago,2024-12-28 17:17:05.114226,1.0,X X,98,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104604418826697243314/reviews?hl=en-GB

Then the manager in charge of registrations did not understand my employer's request to cover my training, certainly due to incompetence. This is dragging on because the new manager is taking care of the registrations for the second wave in mid-September for future students, leaving my file aside.
