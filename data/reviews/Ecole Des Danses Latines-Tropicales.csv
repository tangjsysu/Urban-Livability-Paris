ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQM3VQQUNREAE,Would not recommend at all!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNa05IbW93RRAB,"I joined the school about 2 weeks ago and it has been great so far! (I spent around 16 hours/week there so far). The front desk staff is lovely and very welcoming, everyone of them. They offer several options in terms of memberships but nothing was meeting my situation. Fortunately the owner understood my need and we came up with a good solution :) If you are new to the Latin dances and don't know how to dance in general, the level 1 classes will be good for you but if you already know how to move your body following the music and are good at memorizing steps, work a bit harder and move to the next level ;) because you'll feel a bit bored otherwise, but well, that's normal for group classes and it'll be the same everywhere. Some teachers realized the difference level in the same group and even gave some more advanced steps to the most confortable ones :))) If you are already a dancer I think you will still learn a lot, I had the chance to join the level 2 classes and it's already a way higher level, and they have 4 levels! All teachers are good at what they are doing and I met some really nice people there already  Keep up the good work!! üôåüôåüíÉüï∫",5 years ago,2025-01-24 13:01:27.465304,5.0,Rachid Benadjel,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100244269532941773608/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVNl9yMmpBRRAB,"Fantastic salsa classes. We both have two left feet and have never danced any kind of latin dance before, but their beginner classes were really good for us, with very clear and simple instruction, personal attention and good music to help us with beat. After two months of weekly classes, we were comfortably dancing beginner moves in salsa bars during our trip to Cuba. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in learning salsa in a clear and methodical way, but also looking to have some fun doing so (the teachers we had were all kind and funny).",5 years ago,2025-01-24 13:01:27.467305,5.0,Sonia Naidu,85,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104970762162230002989/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqdnR1RWFBEAE,"Beginner in salsa after 1 year of practice once a week in an association in Ile de France.  I didn't feel at all comfortable in my practice, I lacked technical knowledge, confidence in my guidance, and letting go. Even though I knew the passes, I didn't know how to be comfortable, or how to sequence them or mix them.  So I was looking for a dance school that would make me gain self-confidence and help me progress gently and educationally, while covering all the basics.  After testing a few, I was won over by the very high human and educational quality of the teachers at this school. They all have a different pedagogy and way of teaching, but they group together on the theme of the week which is to be worked on.  For example, one coach will place more emphasis on tempo, another on the placement of the body in space, another on guidance, etc... well you understand, they are all extremely complementary.  We really feel like we're in a private lesson with them. They provide attention, expertise and gentleness that can only help you progress.  For all these reasons I recommend this school, for all the dances it offers.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqcHJ1a1lBEAE,"The tropical Latin dance school is a very enriching experience that I recommend to anyone interested in couple dances.  When I registered, I was looking for solid training to enjoy Salsa and Bachata evenings. I subscribed to a freedom card for a few courses before quickly investing in an unlimited subscription. The cost of this subscription is largely offset by the quality of the education offered; this on condition of investing energy and time.  I took lessons with all the teachers, each in their own way gave me advice, their own pedagogy. This diversity is a plus in the training, as is the ""learning cycle"" system which allows Salsa to acquire the figures step by step.  The school is also a way to connect to Latin American, Caribbean and African cultures, it is not just about dance but about styles, music, social relationships, stories woven around these cultures.  Another positive point is flexibility, whether via the freedom card allowing you to adjust your schedule or via the opening of the school on Sundays where 2-hour courses are offered.  The evenings organized by the school are ideal for getting started. We can express ourselves freely and gain confidence, especially since we dance with partners who take classes with us.
