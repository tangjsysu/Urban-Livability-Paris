ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQMU4yYV9BRRAB,Went here with my team after being recommended to go to see the Pixels exhibit. Very cool and trippy artworks.,3 months ago,2025-03-15 22:31:57.378427,5.0,Leon Winkler (drsleon),176,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107594883626472952331/reviews?hl=en-US

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURab2F6Q0NnEAE,Surprisingly large screen creates an immersive effect. The exposition was on Mucha and the display was well designed along with olfactory elements.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NllTbVl3EAE,"Beautiful museum that you can visit with a stroller, our baby absolutely loved the moving images everywhere and we could let him roam in a museum (for once) ! The Éternel Mucha exhibition was stunning. Not only does it show Mucha's artworks, it gives them a brand new life with an actress posing as Sarah Bernhardt in her different roles for instance. At some point in the exhibition, you'll be given the opportunity to create your own Mucha inspired artwork. Sadly there's only 3 available stations. Compared to the atelier des lumières, this museum has descriptions throughout the walk, it's nice to read about the artist's life.  I love the atelier des lumières for their digital rendering of famous artworks, I felt like the grand palais Immersif did it better. Éternel Mucha is definitely a must go in Paris.",a year ago,2025-03-15 22:31:57.380430,5.0,Michel Heng,43,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111844234654634496011/reviews?hl=en-US

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwNHBLWHp3RRAB,"A type of exhibition hall that is hard to find in Paris. I saw Mucha's video art exhibition. The video art in the main exhibition hall, which you can watch while lying down, brings out the charm of Mucha's works.

Though not rich in info, I liked that it was interactive: you could create and email yousrself your own Mucha inspired poster, the space with ceiling hanged posters, the perfume smelling stations.
