ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRX2VtbVFREAE,"This is one of the best museums especially for romantic and impressionist works. The building itself is a standout and the video at the lower ground entrance worth watching to get some history. Spread over 5 levels the collection has iconic works by well known artists; Degas, Manet, Monet , Van Gogh and the list goes on. The sculptures are amazing and the art nouveau rooms and furniture a real knockout. The Clock Cafe on level 5 has amazing decor and the clock of course. The coffee was absolutely awful.

Walking through its galleries felt like stepping into an art lover’s dream, with iconic paintings around every corner.

ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURneTQ5dRAB,"Absolutely stunning museum. Having been to Paris 6 times it was my first time visiting here and I instantly regretted not having visited sooner.  My 2.5 hours did not feel long enough and you can easily spend half a day here, if not more. I actually loved it more than the Louvre. If you love the impressionist era of paintings this is for you as the collection of Van Gogh, Monet, Renoir and more is incredible. I was also particularly impressed with the painting collection from the Orient. Very vast and beautiful.  I am removing one star (although it pains me to) because the management of the queue on Tuesday the 25th of February in the heavy downpour was abysmal and the worst queue management I have seen ever. I had pre booked a ticket and it seemed to make no difference and I still ended up queueing for over an hour and ended up being soaking wet through to my socks. So walking around the museum in wet socks was not my ideal way to explore so I ended up having to leave early. I felt particularly bad for young children, many of whom were shivering with cold and were not let in despite being there on time.  Please have better management of the queue especially in difficult weather. There were hardly any employees dotted around the queue as they should have been and instead they were concentrated in one place and even then just two of them, which as you can see from the photo was just not enough.
