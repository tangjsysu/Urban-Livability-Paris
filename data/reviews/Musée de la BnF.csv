ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzaFB2ZFd3EAE,A very beautiful museum and library in Paris. I would say THE BEST. They have manuscripts from several regions over the world. I saw rigveda and Mahabharata for the first time in my Life in this museum. They also display a lot of French culture. It also has a really beautiful library. A must visit when in Paris.,4 months ago,2025-03-15 21:55:40.319287,5.0,Rahul Agarwal,254,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118183620553811056026/reviews?hl=en-US

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3cWNITWVBEAE,"A phenomenal little museum in a beautiful library! I'm not usually an antiquities person but their collection is magnificent. The interactive displays were so well done that it actually made me interested in red-figure pottery! The temporary exhibit on revolutions in Paris was a master class in museum design and very informative as an American whose knowledge of French history begins and ends in the 1790s. In addition to its collections, the library is full of wonderful architecture from the 17th through 21st centuries; I stared at the mythology frescoes on the ceiling of the Mazarin Gallery for a good 20 minutes.  Not a ""must-see"" like the Louvre or MusÃ©e d'Orsay, but if you're a museum nerd like me, you'll have a great time.
