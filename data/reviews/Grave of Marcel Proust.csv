His writing is often compared to the works of Kafka in their simplicity and deep understanding of dark side of human psyche.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYeThmd2RBEAE,"As I stand in front of Marcel Proust's grave in the Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris, I feel a deep silence and awe. The simple but elegant tombstone stands out from the more elaborate monuments nearby. It is made of dark, smooth marble and bears only his name, “Marcel Proust,” and the dates of his life (1871–1922). The engraving is subtle, almost reserved, just like the atmosphere of the place.  The grave is often decorated with flowers and small mementos - signs that Proust's work, particularly his monumental In Search of Lost Time, continues to be valued and revered by many. Some visitors leave notes or books on the grave as a tribute to the writer whose literary world so powerfully explored time, memory and human consciousness.  Surrounded by the trees and the many other graves in the extensive cemetery, Proust's final resting place appears peaceful and timeless. It is a quiet place of reflection – fitting for an author who has dedicated his life and work to observing the human experience. As I look at the grave, I realize how much Proust's work shaped the idea of ​​time, and how ironic it is that he rests here, in a place where time itself seems to stand still.
