ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGMll4NxAB,It's an interesting and solemn site of where many royalists died. Its also interesting how it writes and frames things focusing on the supposed tragedy with the events also being the basis of modern french identity.  Price is low and it's worth a look to complete a look into the revolutions; a fine hidden gem if you can withstand some monarchist leaning notes and visitors.,a year ago,2025-01-24 13:27:55.817639,4.0,Brittany Holmes,11,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115575670940741334794/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNMTQzNU1BEAE,"I read some of the comments on Google Maps that criticised the money paid for the little there seemingly is to see. Well, some of the reviewers weren't clearly paying attention. This is a place for contemplation and a place full of significance for a period of the history of France and Europe when enlightened monarchs saw their authority questioned and died at the guillotine. The importance of the place is further added by the fact that only in the early 20th century did the authorities finally put aside the idea of having it demolished. The architecture, the symbolism, are both beautiful.",5 years ago,2025-01-24 13:27:55.819296,5.0,Luis P,178,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104163791600291987773/reviews?hl=en-GB
