ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzMl9mVmZREAE,"A lot of what they have here can be gleamed from Wikipedia and in fact before I came here I read up the wiki page and some is word for word.  It’s a shame that it’s a mostly empty place that relies on augmented reality, but if you have a passion for the revolution then it’s worth ticking off the list. The main area was filled with an African modern art exhibition, which is fine and some was insightful but I came for the history of the place and paid for that. If it wasn’t for the augmented reality I wouldn’t have gone and wouldn’t recommend it, unless you just want to tick places off the list.
