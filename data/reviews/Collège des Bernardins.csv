Founded by the Abbot of Clairvaux who decided to make it a college for the religious of this order, called the Bernardins. 1920: confiscated by revolutionaries and made public. Then, it became a prison for galley slaves, the monks being chased away. Different uses: fire station; National Police boarding school. 2001: purchase by the diocese of Paris to create a Catholic spiritual and cultural center. During the work, a diversion canal for the Bi√®vre was discovered, which made it possible to understand why the College was sinking because it rested on alluvial soil. Buried at a depth of 15 to 25 m, 322 micropiles will support walls and pillars. Complete renovation in 2008. Since then, it has housed the French Catholic Academy.

Guided tours are possible on certain days at 4 p.m. (‚Ç¨8 June 2024) to see other parts of the building.  The Bernardins College is also a place of training since its creation in the 13th century. Many discounts are available for courses etc.  A small counter, La Table des Bernardins, offers simple dishes and bakery pastries with hot and cold drinks. The point is to enjoy the magnificent 800-year-old room. It is worth noting the quality of the cutlery and accessories, including the coasters. A small garden is accessible but does not have much appeal.  A bookstore corner managed by La Procure offers books and objects related to the place in the nave.
