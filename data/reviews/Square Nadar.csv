ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNicVlUVGpBRRAB,We love coming to this park. There are always dogs here no matter what time you go. I love running near this place and stopping to watch them. My dog likes it here too. I would advise anyone that comes here to be careful and keep an eye on their dog at all times as a dog was stolen from here ( they got it back eventually after a very long search by the family) so always keep an eye on your own dog.,5 months ago,2025-01-24 12:56:03.983947,5.0,Brid,441,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118364008054074247056/reviews?hl=en-GB

Tourists can only enter a part of the church, but you can take a tour.  Everyone sat on the steps in front of the association, chatting, drinking, playing music, and having fun as they pleased.  The road from the station to the church is lined with souvenir shops. I think it's an easy spot to get to since it's not that far from the station.
