ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2czRlR1VBEAE,"Pushing through an inconspicuous iron gate leads you into a narrow alley. Welcome to one of Paris's hidden treasures: the Russian Orthodox Church of St. Sergius of Radonezh.  The original German Lutheran church was confiscated during World War I and put up for sale by the French authorities. During the first wave of Russian emigration in 1917, the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral could not accommodate all the believers, and the working population of the 19th district did not feel comfortable in the bourgeois area. Therefore, the Orthodox community of Paris decides to purchase a new temple.  On July 18, 1924, on the day of memory of St. Sergius of Radonezh, the church, located a stone's throw from the Buttes-Chaumont park, was purchased at auction, and in March 1925 it was consecrated.  This is more than a church, it is an institution of Orthodox theology. The pearl of Russian Orthodox thought in the West, it trained hundreds of priests, bishops and theologians in the second half of the 20th century.  Sunday is ideal for visiting - the day of service.",a month ago,2025-02-09 15:08:20.691182,5.0,Sun Power,86,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108552564015995743065/reviews?hl=en-US
