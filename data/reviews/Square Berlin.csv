ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYaTg3bm5RRRAB,"When I enter the Square de Berlin in Paris, I immediately feel the calm atmosphere of this small, hidden park. Located in the 8th arrondissement, near Place de la Madeleine, it is often visited by locals looking for a break from busy city life. I can see the trees surrounding the square and the manicured lawns that give the place a welcoming and relaxing atmosphere. As I walk around I start to think about the history of this place. The Square de Berlin was created in 1822 and was originally known as the Square d'Action Sociale. The name refers to the growing social responsibility of the city administration during this time. The square was designed as a place to promote the common good and create a green oasis in the emerging city. As I observe the people around me, I feel the connection to the past that this place embodies. In 1871, after the end of the Franco-German War, the square was renamed in honor of the capital of Germany, Berlin. It was a symbolic gesture that reflected the new geopolitical realities and Berlin's influence on Europe. I wonder how people felt about these changes at the time and what feelings the renaming made them feel. As I sit on a bench and enjoy the beauty of the square, I notice the little details that make this place so special. There are pretty flowerbeds decorated with colorful blossoms and I can hear the chirping of the birds nesting in the trees. The small sculptures and benches scattered throughout the park also give the square an artistic touch. I can well imagine that this place was once a meeting place for artists and thinkers who sought inspiration in nature. As I continue to stroll through the Square de Berlin, I notice the diversity of people who come here. Families enjoy a picnic, friends chat, and couples stroll hand in hand. It is a place of encounter and exchange that brings people together. I am drawn to this community and can't help but feel a sense of belonging, even if I'm only here temporarily. For me, the Square de Berlin is more than just a beautiful park; it is a place with a rich history that reflects the social changes and political upheavals in France. As I finally stand up to move on, I carry with me the feeling of calm and respect for the past. This little green retreat in the middle of the vibrant city reminds me of the importance of pausing in the hustle and bustle of life and appreciating the beauty around us.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5aDhfMTdnRRAB,"The square is currently under construction, no explanation and no reopening date. Plants such as lilac were planted a few months ago and are now being removed. Disappointing and a waste of time and money. In this square there was also a fountain, the only public fountain on this side if you wanted to cool off. It is now inaccessible due to the work.  Now you have to go to the garden behind the small palace to find a fountain.  This garden is actually not open because of public work. Flowers remove two months after being put there. Sad, not clever, waist of money and time. The only fountain on this garden is no longer available because of the public work.",a year ago,2024-12-28 17:14:56.240162,1.0,FAUVE,2,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109329867905987029055/reviews?hl=en-GB
