ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJcWE2TkpBEAE,"The Fontaine Stravinsky square is situated just outside Centre Pompidou in the Le Marais district of Paris. Little to see/do here other than see the (Stravinsky Fountain) - a an intriguing fountain with 16 whimsical sculptures inspired by and to commemorate the late composer Igor Stravinsky.  The fountain is turned off during the winter months and the pool emptied. However, the various sculptures are always interesting to see, even if just to imagine what the fountain looks like during warmer months of the year. It's fine to give the fountain a few minutes to view and enjoy before/after your visit to the Centre Pompidou.  There is a large scale street art image of a man shushing the crowd just behind the fountain. That is worth a quick look-see if you are into street and graffiti art.",5 years ago,2024-12-28 15:21:05.249901,3.0,Brad,"5,430",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzOUtINGp3RRAB,"Igor Stravinsky Square, located in the heart of Paris next to the Center Pompidou, is a truly unique and lively space, perfect for a cultural and artistic break. The square is famous for its colorful and extravagant fountain, the Fontaine Stravinsky, a work by Jean Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle that pays homage to the Russian composer with playful shapes and moving mechanisms. The bizarre sculptures and bright colors give a modern and dynamic touch, perfect for those who love street art and contemporary art.  Next to the square, stands the Church of Saint-Merri, a Gothic jewel often overlooked by tourists but absolutely worth seeing. The church, with its detailed facade and stained glass windows, creates a charming contrast to the modern style of Pompidou and the fountain. Inside there is an atmosphere of peace and history, and it is one of the few places in the center where you can find a bit of tranquility.
