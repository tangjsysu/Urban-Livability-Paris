ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYN3ZYMkJREAE,"This is an interesting monument dedicated to Auguste Comte (1798-1857), the French philosopher known for his significant contributions to the field of sociology. The monument is the work of sculptor Jean-Antonin Injalbert and was erected at Place de la Sorbonne in 1902.  What you see is a centre bust, below which you will see figure of Clotilde de Vaux, the French intellectual who is credited with inspiring Comte. She is represented as the Madonna with child. To Comte's right is a seated figure representing the embodiment of the working class in pursuit of learning and improvement.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzOUp1U0RnEAE,"Auguste Comte, full name Isidore Marie Auguste Fran√ßois Xavier Comte, also known in Italian as Augusto Comte (Montpellier, 19 January 1798 ‚Äì Paris, 5 September 1857), was a French philosopher, considered the founder of Positivism. Disciple of Henri de Saint-Simon, who was the first to use the term Positivism, he is generally considered the initiator of the positivist philosophical current. Comte coined the term ""social physics"" to indicate a new field of study. However, this definition was also used by some of his rival intellectuals and so, to differentiate his discipline, he invented the word sociology. Comte considered this disciplinary field as a possible terrain for the production of social knowledge based on scientific evidence. Wanting to get rid of metaphysics, he almost religiously exalts the scientific knowledge that aims to observe in order to know without apriorisms. However, he refers to Kant and Leibniz by stating that spontaneous mental dispositions exist in man.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 11:46:46.149042,5.0,daniele pedroni,"1,726",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106356302369543242970/reviews?hl=en-GB
