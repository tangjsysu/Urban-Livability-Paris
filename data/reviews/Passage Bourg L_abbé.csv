ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlN29UeDB3RRAB,"A passage with old charm which seems asleep with these empty or uninteresting stores. However, the architecture of the place is pretty, particularly with this glass roof and its sculpted entrance. The two caryatids by the sculptor Aimé Millet appear as allegories of Commerce on the right and Industry on the left. Falling into disuse in the 1980s, the passage served as a storage area before a violent fire a decade later. A renovation between 2002 and 2008 gave it back its character and since then the passage seems to have emerged from a very long lethargy. Note that the wooden signs of the stores are no longer necessarily in line with the real activity of the business but at least the charm is preserved.",2 years ago,2025-01-24 11:42:33.117004,3.0,Laugal Laugal,817,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102169662098504630831/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzXzZ1N3lBRRAB,"This small passage dates from the beginning of the 19th century. Truncated by the opening of the boulevard, it serves more as a passage from one street to another. However, it is worth noting the caryatids embodying Commerce and Industry on either side of the entrance. A cartridge decorated with a beehive symbolizes economic activity. At each end, a clock and a barometer. You have to stop in front of the Lulli cabinetmaker and carpenter workshop to admire him at work and his beautiful works in the window!",4 years ago,2025-01-24 11:42:33.118004,5.0,Françoise,369,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108799099049503589097/reviews?hl=en-GB
