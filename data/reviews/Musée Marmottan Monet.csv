The collection of Claude Monet is located downstairs, and you can easily spend an hour or two exploring the stories of and behind each art piece.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURndGR1WTVRRRAB,"If you’re a fan of Monet or Impressionism in general, Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris is an absolute must-visit. It’s a bit of a hidden gem compared to the larger museums, and that’s part of its charm.  Housed in what feels like a Parisian maison rather than a typical museum, the space is warm and intimate—like stepping into someone’s beautifully curated home rather than a grand, impersonal gallery. The interior design is elegant, with wood-paneled rooms, chandeliers, and rich, cozy colors that make the experience feel personal and immersive.  And then, of course, there’s the Monet collection. It’s breathtaking. The museum holds the largest collection of his works, including the famous Impression, Sunrise—the painting that literally gave Impressionism its name. The water lilies, the Japanese bridge, the Normandy landscapes—they’re all here, and up close, they feel even more alive.  One of my favorite things about this place is how it allows you to follow Monet’s artistic evolution. You see his earlier, more detailed works and then his later, almost abstract brushstrokes that dissolve into color and light. It’s like watching a master let go of form and embrace pure emotion.  The museum also has pieces from other Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists, but Monet is the star. And because it’s slightly off the beaten path, it doesn’t have the overwhelming crowds of the Orsay or the Louvre. You can actually take your time, breathe, and just be with the art—which feels like the way Monet himself would have wanted it.  If you love Monet, or just want a museum that feels special and a little more personal, Musée Marmottan Monet is a perfect choice.",2 weeks ago,2025-03-15 23:07:34.216622,5.0,Février Photography (parisphotographer),17,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100923379751860723083/reviews?hl=en-US

I walked round the place and found zero directions to the Monet collection. There was absolutely no signage. I had to find somewhere to sit - not easy- and study the map and found the unlabelled staircase in the shop to the basement. The back entrance was at the end of the temporary exhibition.

The concept of a museum housed in a chateau is designed to create a memorable visit. Monet’s Nympheas were the main attraction and were thoroughly enjoyable. Other works by Morisot, Gauguin, and others were also delightful.  However, its narrow and confusing layout made it an unpleasant viewing experience, especially with so many visitors inside.
