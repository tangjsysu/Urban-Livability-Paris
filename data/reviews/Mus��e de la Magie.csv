ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzcThYVWpBRRAB,"First things first, to enter, you descend a long set of stairs, so inaccessible to wheelchairs.  Next, at 15 euros when I visited, it's a pretty steep entry fee for what you get.  And a warning: the place is very much aimed at small children, so if you're not one of those or a parent of one, or a serious connoisseur of magic and magic history, you may find it a bit of a tourist trap.  My first impression was it had fantastic ambience with low light (I'm light-sensitive) and cave-like ambience as it's in a former basement.  On arrival, depending on the schedule, you're invited to a magic show in a little theater. While conducted in French, I understood enough to enjoy. The tricks and illusions were on the basic side, so if you are a magic connoisseur, you might not be taken with them, but I found them--and the magician--very entertaining.  Once the show's over, they funnel you into the heart of the museum, which has a number of genuinely fascinating pieces. The optical illusions were a highlight. Though once you've taken those in, which takes, at most, half an hour, that's kind of it. Being near-sighted, I didn't even bother reading most of the signs, so that probably detracted from my experience.  The other half of the museum is the automotons. For those who don't know, these are little doll-like figures constructed to repetitively perform entertaining tasks when you press a button. Some were very cool while others I've completely forgotten about. In total, they take up about two and a half rooms.  And that's it! One big room full of artifacts and interactive optical illusions and another couple of rooms full of push-button performers.  One final warning: some of the pieces, especially the older posters, lean toward the culturally insensitive, so if you're not into that, maybe avoid.  Overall, it was a fun hour of exploration, so if you're looking for something for the kids, it's cheaper and closer than Disneyland, but you will run out of things to do before you know it. Without the very friendly and helpful staff, it would've been three stars.",a month ago,2024-12-27 21:54:14.738244,4.0,Anton Hill,98,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113991054635392266263/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnd3VUOGpnRRAB,"This is a great museum for kids and lovers of magic. The automatic part of the museum really wasn't that amazing. I was hoping for more creepy dolls, most of the artefacts were kinda dull. Kids would enjoy the ""pushing buttons"" factor. The magic museum side was pretty cool. Live magic and some nice interactive displays. There was a bunch of kids having a birthday party so was filled with laughter.
