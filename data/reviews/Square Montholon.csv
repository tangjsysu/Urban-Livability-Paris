ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIaU1TRVRREAE,"Nice small neighbourhood park. Equipped with a basketball court, a ping pong table and a good selection of slides and swings. It is pretty well kept, and mostly frequented by the more well-off ''bobo'' inhabitants of the neighbourhood, although I am told there used to be the odd used syringe in the bushes, so keep an eye out if you're  with small kids. I think it's very safe and clean during the day, perhaps not so much at night, but you're not supposed to go there at night anyway. It's a nice quiet oasis in an otherwise noisy and rather hectic area.",3 months ago,2024-12-28 17:03:01.728288,4.0,G D,16,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114295805374676355924/reviews?hl=en-GB
