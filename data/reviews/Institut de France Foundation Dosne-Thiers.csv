ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQcU1LZXFRRRAB,"A very special and interesting museum-library. Specialized in the general, political, military, social and administrative history of France, from the Revolution to the First World War. Originally it was the private mansion of Adolphe Thiers, president of the French Republic from 1871 to 1873.
