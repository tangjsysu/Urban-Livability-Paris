ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0NGF2UGpnRRAB,"In a legendary place, a tiny part of the incredible collection of Mr Benincasa senior who collected and restored more than 2000 models over 50 years. Of the 2000 cameras that make up this collection, around a hundred are revealed to the public by Mr Benincasa fils. Through this collection we travel through the history of photography with emblematic, curious, unusual and incredible models.  Whether you are an amateur, a pro or simply curious, you will not be indifferent. Moreover, it is an evolving exhibition because as certain models are restored, they are exhibited.  A fun and informative exhibition at a time when the camera is part of our life and fits in the pocket that we draw for a yes or a no, not so far from a time when we saved the pedicle in admiration in front of these pieces of goldwork with a mechanical heart but far from the battle of pixels and digital technology.
