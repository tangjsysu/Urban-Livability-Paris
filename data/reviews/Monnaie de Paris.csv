ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQdnNtdXBnRRAB,"This museum is a hidden gem, offering one of the most captivating experiences in Paris.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiZ1BxdW1BRRAB,"We had a really good time visiting the Minnie de Paris Museum, specifically the Arcade exhibit that had vintage video and pinball machines that you could play.  If you purchased entry to the exhibit online, they gave you 12 tokens to play the games.  Some of the machines were free to play (at the front of the exhibit).  It was a lot of fun to go back in time to play machines that I knew when they first came out.  Even more fun to be able to play with my kids.  My only encounter with someone rude in France happened here, however.  There were lineups to play and everyone was waiting patiently‚Ä¶ except one individual behind me who took exception to the fact that one of my kids and I were quite good on one machine‚Ä¶ and had a fit like a 2 yr old because she had to wait.  Luckily my French is limited so I couldn‚Äôt understand her‚Ä¶ so it didn‚Äôt bother me.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoa2V5NkxBEAE,"A numismatic paradise in the heart of Paris  The Mus√©e de la Monnaie is a treasure trove of history and art that any coin or medal enthusiast would be thrilled to discover. From the moment you step into the elegant building, you are transported to a world of intricate designs, intricate engravings, and fascinating stories. I was absolutely blown away by the quality and diversity of the exhibits, which cover everything from ancient coins to contemporary pieces.  Visitors are treated to a feast for the eyes and the mind, as the museum offers both stunning visual displays and informative labels that explain the context and significance of each item. The ambiance is quiet and refined, making it easy to fully immerse yourself in the experience. The service is excellent, with knowledgeable staff on hand to answer any questions and guide you through the collection.  What makes the Mus√©e de la Monnaie truly special is the opportunity to witness the artistry and craftsmanship that goes into creating these miniature works of art. The museum features a workshop where you can watch skilled artisans at work, using traditional techniques to produce beautiful medals and coins.  I cannot find any fault with this museum and would give it a perfect score. My only suggestion would be to offer more interactive exhibits or hands-on activities for children, but this is a minor point. I would highly recommend the Mus√©e de la Monnaie to anyone interested in the history of money, art, or both. It is truly a gem in the heart of Paris.  To the owners and staff of the Mus√©e de la Monnaie, I would like to express my gratitude for the exceptional experience you have created. Your passion for your subject shines through in every detail, and I left feeling inspired and enriched. I would definitely consider returning and hope that others will take the opportunity to discover this hidden gem.",a year ago,2024-12-28 16:06:20.728358,5.0,Reda Haddou,506,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114553008799835481583/reviews?hl=en

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZLTlXaHR3RRAB,"This is one of the most underrated sites we visited.  I researched the Conti 11 before arriving to Paris and our visit did not disappoint. There is a lot to see here and it‚Äôs never crowded, we did not visit the exhibition portion as we were tired and pressed for time, but the museum portion was extraordinary.  There are also interactive exhibits which is mainly for kids but my husband and I enjoyed them as well. We went on a Saturday and it was not busy at all really quiet and peaceful, the only downfall was that the windows showing the workshops had no people working in them, I assume this would be even more interesting to see the people working on site. Still very cool. The current exhibit is on until February of 2020, seen some of the artists work online, worth seeing if you have the time, visiting just the museum portion is 10 euros and museum plus exhibit is 12 euros.
