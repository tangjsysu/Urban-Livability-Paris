ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYbXZ2M0NnEAE,"I did not know about this until a friend told me. This is the former residence of French novelist Honor√© de Balzac. It was in the outskirts of Paris at the time. It was the guest house of a larger estate. It contains a lot of artifacts, drawings, sculptures and writing related to Balzac. The cottage is small but worth visiting. The main attraction for me is the outdoor garden.  A lot of flowers and plants and a lot of places just to sit and take in the quiet. A small cafe on site is very nice too.
