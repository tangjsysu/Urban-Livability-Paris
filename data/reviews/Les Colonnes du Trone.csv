ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNobDlfTWlnRRAB,"It's always interesting to discover the history and secrets of Parisian monuments. The Barri√®re du Tr√¥ne is an emblematic place that deserves to be visited. Located at the corner of Avenue du Tr√¥ne and Boulevard de Picpus, it is decorated with two statues: that of Philippe Auguste sculpted by Dumont is located on the 12th arrondissement side and that of Saint Louis sculpted by Etex is located on the 11th arrondissement side.  The latter is also at the origin of the statue of G√©ricault du P√®re Lachaise, which makes him a very talented artist.  A visit to the Barri√®re du Tr√¥ne is therefore an excellent opportunity to admire his work from afar, of course, but while waiting to have the right to use a drone in town, which may take time (or which will not happen in order to to avoid certain excesses) it will be necessary to be content with this observation distance.
