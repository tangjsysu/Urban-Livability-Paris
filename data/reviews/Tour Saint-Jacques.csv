At the top are the four biblical symbols: the angel, the lion, the bull, the eagle, and the statue of Saint James the Great dressed as a pilgrim (4 meters high). The 58-meter-high Saint-Jacques Tower was originally placed on the side of the Church of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie, which was destroyed during the Revolution.
