ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3M2ZYT0RnEAE,"Paris Mon Amour. As a song says. Here I am again - Me voil√† de retour. I regret nothing, love comes and goes - Je ne regrette rien, non L'amour √ßa va, √ßa vient. This is a love story between us - C'est une histoire d'amour entre nous. There is an infinite amount to say about Paris. It is not called the 'City of Love' for nothing. Anyone who has been there once will long to return to this city again and again. It is the atmosphere, the language, the sounds and the smells, especially when you can stay there as a couple. I feel the same way.. I got there twice by plane and once by train. It took about 1 1/2 hours from Munich to Paris. A good 8 hours by train. I was able to stay in this city as a guest for a week each time. We crossed the city on foot. There are cafes on every street corner all of which invite you to linger. There are many small hotels to stay in, which may not have the comfort of the big hotels, but are typical of France, small, cozy and clean. I am an atheist but Sacr√©-C≈ìur de Montmartre has always been a sacred and magical place that should be approached with respectful silence and respectful quietness. Friends were there in the middle of the month and provided me with the pictures. Paris is definitely worth a trip, no, several times. Don't miss out on this city!
