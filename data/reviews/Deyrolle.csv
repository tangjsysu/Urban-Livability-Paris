Incredible array of specimens, insects and animals, and lots of great books on animals and nature, for adults and children both.  All animals have died in captivity - no hunting or unethical animal practices. They have solid ethics behind them.  No photos allowed inside so all other reviewers with photos have obviously disregarded this. Staff were helpful and polite.

We bought a scorpion in a double glass frame as a gift . But after a while then pinchers started to move and didn't stay in position. Apparently it wasn't dry enough. The product was brought back to the shop after having it for approx 5-6monts. After now 6 months the  scorpion is still not back! The gifted person had to call numerous times, often without any real answer. They didn't reach out to him for updates. Although the person he spoke to was friendly and professional it seems they are just buying time and are not transparent about the process.  It seems that the workshop is not in store which makes it more problematic to get updated about the process.

The mounted animals are quite pricy but the butterfly section is preset reasonable, think 25 euro per specimen. If you ask for help, they can get you an empty frame box and you can just pick exactly what you want from drawers and drawers of insects and they will pin them to the board in the frame and you are good to go. For 200 euros you can get a nice framed piece. We also wanted to get a cicada mounted under a glass dome.

There was SO MUCH there and you could get anything from a book to a plant press to an inexpensive shell to a taxidermy duckling (100 euros Nov 2022) to insects from all over.  There were much larger and more expensive animals too, including an incredible black cow or bull with butterflies displayed inside.  It is probably most helpful to speak at least some French there if you're wanting anything custom.  I speak ok French, so I was able to ask about their available display frames, selecting my own specimens from the region I desired (and where in the shop those insects were located), and so on.  You can browse and select what you like and they will handle them and place in a frame for you.  I'm sure you could be as particular as you wanted with things.  They also will add extra pins along the sides of each specimen to stabilize the insect bodies for travel.  They provide all necessary import paperwork and certifications.  I had no trouble at Customs in the US when I declared my items.  My 6 year old was enthralled with the place and even my skeptical husband was impressed (this isn't his thing).  I cannot recommend them enough.  They are masters of their craft, recognized by the French government as such.  They sell a book on the history of Deyrolle, both French and English versions, and full of beautiful photos.  You cannot take photos in the shop, so this is a great souvenir.  They obtain their specimens ethically (e.g. zoo deaths for many taxidermy items) and they also sell original artwork from visiting artists who have incorporated their specimens.  I only wish they weren't an ocean away.

It's reminiscent of a natural history museum that crams its tigers in with its peacocks and porcupines and sloths -- and they're all there in taxidermied glory.. Everywhere you look, there's so much to discover. Books (mostly in French) on topics from mycology to myrmecology, posters with vintage nature illustrations, nature-inspired art -- it simply astounds. And then you reach the back room, which, for fans of invertebrates, is the most amazing. Cases and cases of carefully pinned and labeled insects, spiders, centipedes and scorpions, ranging from minute to enormous, fill the room. Nothing is cheap. In fact, several pieces are surprisingly costly. But it seems clear that anything purchased from Deyrolle will be of high quality and appealing to the nature lover (particularly the scientifically minded one) in your life.
