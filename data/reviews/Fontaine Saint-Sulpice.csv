ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzcE9DaHdRRRAB,Beautiful square with imposing water fountain located in front of the Eglise Saint Sulpice. Nice area to take in a breather or simply enjoy the architecture and vibe that Paris has to offer. It is a relatively quiet place so not too crowded. It is located in an area that appears to be a fairly affluent district of Paris with specialist designer shops. Both the church and the fountain are cool places to frequent or visit.,a month ago,2024-12-28 15:10:44.719061,5.0,Legends l,332,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104541174484791706965/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvOVphOU5nEAE,"An attractive fountain called the Fountain of the Four Bishops can be found at Place St. Sulpice near the edge of the St. Germain and Luxemburg districts. It is worth a quick stop if you intend to spend time in the Luxemburg district or if you are purposely seeking to visit the Church of St. Sulpice during your trip to Paris.  This fountain was built by Joachim Visconti between 1844 and 1848 and features statues of past bishops on each side of the fountain. These include Bishop Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet (North), Bishop Esprit Fl√©chier (East), Bishop Jean-Baptiste Massillon (South) and Bishop Fran√ßois F√©nelon (West).  The Fountain of the Four Bishops is quite nice to see in the warmer months of the year. However, during winter, the fountain is turned off, emptied of water and the trees, which line the square are devoid of leaves, making this a less appealing attraction and area to spend time during this part of the year.",5 years ago,2024-12-28 15:10:44.724845,4.0,Brad,"5,430",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en
