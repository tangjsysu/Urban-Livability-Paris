There are lots of names and domain names at this university: u-paris.fr, parisdescartes.fr, Paris Cit√©, Paris V, etc.  The organization, seen from the outside, is a real artifice to me, like your public information broken down into your multiple domain names. I am carrying out a search related to your university and, systematically, I cannot find an up-to-date answer and answer. This experiment was repeated several times, always with the same result. Sometimes your site states the opposite of what the facts are. This is how your site indicates valid training which is not communicated on your e-candidate platform; disturbing for the student.  This is problematic: it is impossible to contact the training managers by email. Either they are ghosting or they are not receiving or transmitting to me.
