ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqcVlINmR3EAE,"Personally, I liked the park and my kids loved the tiered playground.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMjQtRTd3RRAB,"It's a nice park. If you do go all to the way to the top there is a bit of a view with the Eiffel tower in the distance but it's in the distance and the view is somewhat obstructed? Anyway, there are roses and other flowers planted so at certain times of year I'd bet it looks particularly attractive. In my autumn visit the leaves had turned yellow on some trees and it's kinda nice. It has park benches and an amphitheatre. Overall looks deceptively small but there's quite a bit to it, mostly in cosy sized sections.",2 years ago,2024-12-28 16:59:10.348987,4.0,Paul Nguyen,460,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114101813378126451743/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcTlIdVZREAE,One of my favorite parks in Paris. It’s small but has nice corners like the amphitheater area but also in the summer there is enough space for picnics and tanning.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzbUl6Q2FREAE,"They are very serious about no dogs! I didn't notice the sign at first but someone literally opened a window in the building by the entrance and told us our dog couldn't come. I don't really understand why, it's nice but not as manicured as other Parisian parks like jardin du Luxembourg. My husband took the dog while I walked through the park but I would have felt much safer with them. The belvédère at the top has a nice view of the Eiffel. It can also be accessed from other roads so my dog and husband were able to rejoin me to look at the Eiffel. I signed a petition for them to allow dogs, I hope they get more signatures!",a month ago,2024-12-28 16:59:10.349987,3.0,Marissa Black,65,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113028599367925661259/reviews?hl=en

I started near the top of Parc de Belleville which has nice views of Paris and then wandered down thru Belleville.

Rue Denoyez).",a year ago,2024-12-28 16:59:10.349987,4.0,Irma Zandl,827,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101579716857027286357/reviews?hl=en
