ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzMU5UVllREAE,We stumbled across this circus while wandering around le marais and booked tickets for the following day and was so glad we did! This show exceeded our expectations in every way. All of the acts were amazing but what really sets it apart is the live band. The venue is also beautiful. We went to Moulin Rouge in the evening and we agreed that this circus was 10 times better! There is a quick intermission so you can stretch your legs - the seats are a little snug.,a month ago,2024-12-28 15:26:29.929244,5.0,Vanessa Min,17,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106991329537232373493/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoeHNxc3lBRRAB,"This was an excellent show! Much better than I had anticipated. The acts are varied and the pace is broken down with a number of comic bits including a ball-fight with the audience that the kids were so thrilled with.  The acrobats and performers did a fantastic job.  There were only two aspects that took away from a perfect rating - the first was a mess up with allocating adjacent seats, which the system auto picked, but were inconvenient. If you are picking seats, the first three rows are the comfortable one. The hall is small and most seats have enough elevation for a good view, but there is nothing quite like being within touching distance of performers.  The second was a near admonish from a performer that we hadn't brought ""cash for tips"" - not that I saw him doing the same with any of the other locals. That was a little disappointing.",a year ago,2024-12-28 15:26:29.933244,4.0,Deepali Gupta,63,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116634019272210153021/reviews?hl=en

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0ajZPb3pBRRAB,"We attended the show as a family of 4 - my wife and I plus our son (7.5) and daughter (3). None of us speak a word of French but I had understood from other reviews that this was not an issue - I can say that is absolutely true. I would say that not speaking French even adds something to the experience as the brief moments where dialogue is used you can still comprehend anyway.  The show itself is simply spectacular - I had high hopes but it surpassed them easily. There is so much variety, so much entertainment and so much skill on display from the performers that you do not have a second to sit back - its edge of the seat stuff and I would urge everyone to go and see for themselves. During the interval there was some lovely snacks to purchase along with drinks and some mementos from the show - some of the performers were even there to have a chat to and sign the programs too.  This is one of the best things we've ever seen and we would return over and over when we go back to Paris.",10 months ago,2024-12-28 15:26:34.092411,5.0,Edward & Poonam Stammers,24,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115018985107099589301/reviews?hl=en

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCNGFTQktnEAE,"We only got to enjoy the first half show. My 2 year daughter got hurt really bad on the way back to the stadium from bathroom. I am sure the couple employees by the door saw my daughter walking towards me, one employee with short gray hair with glasses on just walked directly towards my daughter, which caused my baby fell forward. We left with Two chipped front teeth with swollen lips on her without finishing the show. It was so traumatic for all of us. Even though there was a doctor who checked her, the fact that my daughter is injured doesn’t go away. And the injury would most likely affect her permanent teeth according to the dentist. If you are actually charging for kids 2 years up, there should be more child proof and all the employees need to be alert and aware. I emailed them yesterday but no response.
