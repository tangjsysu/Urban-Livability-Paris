ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIeDQycXpRRRAB,"Do not hesitate to climb the few steps which provide access to a very pretty garden, with trees and flowers. Close to the Cit√© internationale des arts which welcomes artists from all over the world in residence, this garden has been redeveloped and expanded in 2020. It brings together three previously distinct spaces: the Albert Schweitzer square, the Jardin des Arts and the French garden of the Administrative Tribunal of Paris in its upper part. The accessible lawns are decorated with flowers, shrubs and flower beds, creating rest areas for walkers. The garden offers wide circulation areas lined with trees which encourage walking and discovery of the place, as well as a play area. This garden pays homage to Albert Schweitzer (1875-1965), missionary doctor, philosopher, musician and musicologist, Bach specialist. In 1913, he founded the Lambar√©n√© hospital in Gabon, and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952.",4 months ago,2025-02-09 14:56:20.105786,4.0,Laurent Padou,851,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102878442016850755868/reviews?hl=en
