ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3dDdHZ2x3RRAB,This is a quiet little park in the middle of one of my favorite parts of Paris.  It is not far from the Pompidou. I did not go up in the tower but it was a nice experience all the same. There were plenty of benches to sit on with trees accompanying them to provide some shade. If the benches are full there is plenty of grass to lay on.  This is a good place to read or to have picnic with friends.,7 years ago,2024-12-27 21:24:49.571795,5.0,Wes Watkins,134,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104520359071690941244/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvOFp6V0JBEAE,"This the small public park along Rue de Rivoli where you find Tour Saint-Jacques, a stand alone medieval tower that is 52 metres. The park opened in 1856. Here you will find a few park benches and grassy spots within the park but otherwise, you stop by here to see the 16th century tower. Square opening hours are 8.30am to 5.30pm daily.  Tour Saint-Jacques was originally part of a larger church built on this site between 1509-23. The church was destroyed at the end of the 18th-century and not rebuilt. What remains is the church tower which you see today. The tower is Flamboyant Gothic in architectural style and highly decorative. You can view well when approaching along Rue de Rivoli or from up close within the park.  Notice the statue to French mathematician, Blaise Pascal at the base of the tower. This is worth a quick look-see when passing by Square de la Tour Saint Jacques if you enjoy viewing monuments and statues during your travels.",5 years ago,2024-12-27 21:24:49.572795,4.0,Brad,"5,430",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en
