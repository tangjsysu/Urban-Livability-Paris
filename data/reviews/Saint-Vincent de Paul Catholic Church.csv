ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzamFEOWR3EAE,This is probably my favourite church in Paris. The outside may not be the most beautiful but inside this church is tastefully decorated. It is very tranquil and has beautiful wooden floors. The lightning in the church coupled with the ornaments and figures are so beautiful. It is not frequented by many tourists so you pretty much have time to see everything. And it’s all free but you can make a donation if you so wish. Please note that entrance is to the rear and not the front. It has two entrances to the back and they close at lunchtime for a break. The church is not far from Gare Du Nord. This place in my view is a hidden gem.,a month ago,2024-12-27 20:32:43.927399,5.0,Legends l,332,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104541174484791706965/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDeFpuVVpREAE,"The church was built during 1824–44, on the site of the ancient Saint-Lazare prison enclosure. In that enclosure had been located the Maison Saint-Lazare, occupied by Vincent de Paul— it was here that he lived and worked— and afterwards by the Congrégation de la Mission, from 1632 to 1793.  The church's design and the initial phases of its construction were entrusted to Jean-Baptiste Lepère, a French architect of modest reputation. The first stone was laid in August 1824 in the presence of the préfet de la Seine Gaspard de Chabrol and the archbishop of Paris Mgr de Quélen. Work proceeded slowly, and was repeatedly abandoned, being especially delayed because of a lack of credit as a result of the 1830 Revolution. Thus it was Lepère's son-in-law, Jacques Hittorff, who finally followed the project through from 1831 to 1844. The building opened for worship on 25 October 1844.  The nave and apse from the west end tribune Hittorff massively modified the initial plans (which did not plan for even one tower), with his church opening onto the Place Franz-Liszt, giving the building a church square. He also added a system of ramps, laid out today in gardens, to aid access by horse-drawn carriages.",4 years ago,2024-12-27 20:32:43.927399,5.0,Basem Maher,214,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107509924251177799315/reviews?hl=en-GB
