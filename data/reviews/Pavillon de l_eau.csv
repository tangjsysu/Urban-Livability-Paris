For someone who's interested in water quality and infrastructure it answered a lot of my questions.   I got lucky and had the exhibition to myself, as I heard a loud school group just exiting.  Check out their website where it shows the water quality and map of where the public drinking fountains are.  Also, it shows the free sparkling water (petillante sp?) Sources are.  Imagine that, free sparkling water to the masses?!  What a city Pairs is!
