ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2MDhpZ2VnEAE,"We were nicely greeted by what seemed like the owner of the restaurant and the waitstaff. We ordered two bottles of Pinot Noir which were delicious. We ordered the French onion soup and the scallop tartar which was the special, both were yummy. Then we ordered the steak tartare, and another special which was the fish and carrots the mushroom pasta and the steak ribs. We were told the steak ribs was sold out which was fine so we went with the crock Monsour. The steak tartare was under seasoned and lacked many classic ingredients. The Crock monsuir egg was completely raw however was yummy. The linguine was extremely under-seasoned and lacked flavour and the fish special with the carrots was honestly inedible. The service was amazing and the atmosphere was lovely but a miss from us.",a month ago,2025-01-24 13:48:25.446579,2.0,Tayah Freeman,27,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105939011862025644033/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUcU1ubjV3RRAB,"This place was highly recommended by a Parisian friend, and we had high hopes. While it was good, it was not as great as we were hoping. For starter, I had the asparagus soup, which was delicious. For my main, I had the fillet mignon, which, much to my surprise, was almost cooked ""well done."" I always like beef cooked medium rare and never had to be too specific about this in France, but this was an unhappy accident (maybe its because they seem to be catering mostly tourists that ask for disappointing well done steaks ?). For dessert, I had a chocolate cake, which was a massive disappointment - dry and unremarkable - something that would only be fit if this would be someone's first cake.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzdFp5aGd3RRAB,"Beware, change of direction! I had previously been 3 times to this restaurant which I have always loved, but unfortunately it‚Äôs no longer the same experience. Upon arrival, noticing the decor and ambiance had lost its charm, I was already worried. From there it was a disaster‚Ä¶ a bland ‚Äòclassic bistro‚Äô menu and a worthlessly short and poor wine list confirmed that the restaurant had changed hands. They made a mistake on 2 of our starters, and the 3rd had to be re-heated as arrived cold. We were told at late notice that they had run out of their signature aligot and mashed potatoes yet could offer chips or saut√©ed potatoes (clearly not home-made as otherwise could have been mashed) despite there being only a few tables before us. They didn‚Äôt have the wine we wanted (despite such a limited selection) the food was as bland as the menu itself and the waiters tried their best to reassure the entire complaining restaurant as the service was so long, but were stressed and making mistakes all the way along. After a ripoff meal we appreciate the gesture of a free dessert but I could have made it better myself at home. The new direction has ruined what was a fantastic establishment, which is unacceptable in Paris with so many incredibly alternatives. All the guests were rolling their eyes and trying to laugh between us to keep up spirits but it was clear none of us would be back.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 13:48:25.452583,1.0,Edward Taylor,12,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108231594181806125815/reviews?hl=en-GB

For main I has Veal cheek with mash potato. The dish was under seasoned for my taste and also has a piece of something in the mash that was not meant to be there, but these things happen. The under seasoning was easily fixed by adding salt and pepper myself. The veal was cooked perfectly.

Liked the place so much that we went back for dinner. While ordering food from one of the outdoor tables, it suddenly began to rain and we quickly transferred to a full house inside the restaurant. What was really impressive was how Caroline managed a packed restaurant with a smile on her face under a lot of pressure (new people arrived at the door who she couldn't accommodate).

We stumbled across this restaurant by accident, whilst in the area, and out of all the places we visited this truly was such an enjoyable memorable experience.
