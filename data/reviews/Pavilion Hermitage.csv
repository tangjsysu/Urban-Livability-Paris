ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3aHNmTTNnRRAB,"Cool little neighborhood museum in a small, pretty park in the Charonne neighborhood on the outskirts of the Paris 20th Arrondissement. There is a small exhibit in the remaining portion of a 17th century ""follie"" (basically a 'small' country chateau where the nobility would escape from the city to) about the building's history, and various special exhibits. When I was there the two special exhibits were on Charonne's history, and the history of the horse based economy at the end of the 19th century. Very interesting. The main exhibit has an English translation, but the special exhibits did not, though the photos were still interesting, and it was possible to decipher some of the explanation. Its only 3 Euro's to visit so if you're in the area worth a stop. The Charonne neighborhood is very cute and retains many vestiges of the ancient village that was here before being absorbed by Paris in 1860",6 years ago,2025-01-24 12:02:21.226168,5.0,Nathaniel Miller,33,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102724345815568884222/reviews?hl=en-GB

The place is also an old Parisian folly and is one of the rare Regency style buildings in the capital. The pavilion contains some sublime murals. Today, the place hosts exhibitions and tours and its garden is a perfect place for a beautiful stroll.
