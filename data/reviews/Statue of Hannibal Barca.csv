ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzaHJqU3N3RRAB,"The statue of Hannibal (247 - 183BC) is located at the western end of the Central Alley near the Octagonal Basin. The original was the work of Sebastien Slodtz (1704) and was erected in 1722. That statue was moved to the Louvre in 1872.  What you see now is a marble replica showing the Carthage general and noted nemesis of the Roman Empire in classical depiction. Interestingly, situated just across the Alley from a similar statue of Emperor Julius Cesar which was created as a pair with this work of Hannibal and erected at the same time.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 11:26:48.129102,3.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en
