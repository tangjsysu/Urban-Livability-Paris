ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLXzhLQ3pRRRAB,"The monument to the engineer Eugène Flachat (1802-1873), located at Carrefour Pereire – Verniquet – Roll, on the edge of Bd Pereire, was created in 1897 by Alfred Boucher (1850-1934). Eugène Flachat is a French engineer. He collaborated on the studies of one of the first French railway lines, Paris – Le Pecq inaugurated on August 28, 1837, then that of Paris to Versailles RD (1840-1842). The names of the 2 Flachat brothers, Eugène and Stéphane, both engineers, are worthy of remaining attached to the history of the great industrial and financial movement inaugurated in France around 1830 and from which its railway network emerged, thanks to in the joint competition of Emile & Isaac Pereire, Lamé, Clapeyron, Perdonnet, Baron James de Rothschild, etc. Eugène Flachat is one of the 72 scientists whose name is inscribed on the 1st floor of the Eiffel Tower, on the frieze of the four facades, in homage to men of science. It is the 15th, on the North face (18 names per face). -------------------- Gustave Eiffel had the names of 72 scientists inscribed on the banner that runs all around the first floor of the Tower. But how did he choose them and with what intention? The first floor of the Tower is surrounded by a large continuous beam, punctuated by the rhythm of the consoles which support the balcony which goes around it. On the intervals thus provided, Gustave Eiffel had the names of scientists inscribed, written in golden capital letters, 60 cm high and therefore large enough to be read from the ground. 18 are thus written on each side, in random order. He thus placed his Tower under the auspices of science and progress, within the framework of the centenary of the French Revolution, and of which his Tower was one of the most visible expressions. Because the choice of these scientists and engineers responded to several considerations. They are all French people who lived and worked between 1789 and 1889. Another criterion was the length of the names. Given the space available, each could not contain more than twelve letters (Lechatellier), omitting the first names. For this reason, various scholars were not selected, such as Étienne Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire. Unfortunately, there are no women among these 72 names. They were covered with paint at the beginning of the 20th century before being restored between 1986 and 1987 by the Société d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SETE).",3 years ago,2024-12-27 21:38:06.216022,5.0,Jean Marco92,643,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114146936200095763256/reviews?hl=en-GB
