ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzdjhyOUNnEAE,This museum is the best place to know about the immigration history of France. You gain so much how France has changed and evolved and revolutionized over the years and has welcomed every race and ethnicity.,4 months ago,2025-03-15 22:13:27.912344,4.0,Rahul Agarwal,254,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118183620553811056026/reviews?hl=en-US
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwejY3UGZnEAE,A newly renovated museum with an interesting story. The building is interesting to look around and you can visit the big main room for free. There is a cafe and cloak room. A lot of the actual museum mostly had writing on the walls with some objects and a couple of videos. Because of this I don’t think it’s very interesting for young children. The information on big panels is translated to English and the smaller panels just in french. There’s a music room where you can listen to playlists and relax part way through your visit. The museums follows the history of immigration in France all the way up to the present day. Underneath the museum there is a tropical aquarium. I went on a weekday in summer and it wasn’t busy.,a year ago,2025-03-15 22:13:27.913346,4.0,Amelia Dellamuro,113,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114177431462636356390/reviews?hl=en-US

It was too noisy with groups of teenagers with guides and difficult to navigate around them so prolonging my time as I had to move on and go back when they had moved on.  I think these groups should have special times allocated just for them, not same time as general public.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGdVlhNHNnRRAB,"A highly disappointing visit. This museum has managed to take the most interesting subject of history, and convert it into the most boring museum visit I have ever had in my life.

Although my children do not speak French, there were English translations throughout the museum to make it more than worthwhile.
