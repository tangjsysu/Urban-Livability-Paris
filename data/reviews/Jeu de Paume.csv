ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVNnJ2MmN3EAE,"EXPO SALLY MANN +++ THE PAINS OF THE SOUTH ++ EMMETT FLOATING ++ COLLODIUM ++ GO AND SEE ++ AN ANGEL FOR SALLY MANN  Certainly, Jeu de Paume is one of the finest places in Europe to see expositions of photograph artists. So, Josef Sudek, or Andr√© Kertesz some time ago. The current Expo of Sally Mann is - convincingly - of very radical nature. Starting with the early pictures of her three children , amounting today to a kind of miracle, Sally Mann took always a lot of ""insight"" on her. The expo is cut in five ""subject-parts"", and one of the most fascinating are the so called ""Black Water"" pictures,  really ""tirages"" in the old French style. Or, other subject (matter), the battlefields of the South, rough, but wonderful. And then the Little Videos, shown at the expo, Sally Mann with grey hair (she is born in 1951). Collodium Floating on glass plates. This is not an ""easy go"", but 90 minutes at the expo will comfort you a lot. It took me six hours (each time) by train to come and to go, but is was quite a unique occasion (as Josef Sudek earlier). And Sally Mann, also, is a very interesting example that there is a withhold against the simply ""loudspeaking world"". Subtle Pictures of the South ! Congratulation ! After the visit, I was talking to a lot of interested People, in photography. How to sustain ""pain"" is one of the most fundamental subjects you can Encounter, and Sally Mann did very well, also at Jeu de Paume ! Go and see the ""Black Water"" Pictures, and the Battlefields.

The Jeu de Paume museum hosts temporary exhibitions that explore various themes and artistic practices. It features a diverse range of photography, video art, and other forms of contemporary visual arts. The museum often collaborates with international artists and curators, making it a dynamic and engaging cultural institution.

As we entered the building, the girl at the entrance was already very grumpy. She didn't speak a word in English although my friend told her that he doesn't understand a word in French. Then she told us to put his backpack in one of the safes, which obviously were way to small. So when we bought our tickets we asked if we could take the bag inside, the man already said yes, but then this girl from the entrance came running up to us, and told us, again in a very unfriendly way that it was not possible to take it inside.  Today I visited the museum. I am a big fan of photography, but for the price the collection is very poor. And really not that spectacular. The short films in the top floor are nice, but again really not worth the price.
