ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnMklUUlZBEAE,"A monument steeped in history in memory of King Alexander 1st of Yugoslavia and his father King Peter 1st, king of Serbia from 1903 to 1919 (there is an avenue Pierre 1st of Serbia in the 16th and 8th arrondissement of Paris), then from 1919 king of the Serbs, Slovenes and Croats, he was active at our side within the foreign legion during the Franco-Prussian war in autumn 1870 under the name of Pierre Kara (the story is recorded on the monument). This monument was inaugurated in 1936 in memory of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia assassinated on October 9, 1934 in Marseille on rue de la Canebière in the presence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Louis Barthou (see avenue Louis Barthou not far from here), himself even died the same day from a stray bullet not caused by the assassin of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia (there were other victims among the public who came to see the king that day, they were caused by shots which were not caused by the assassin). This had catastrophic repercussions within the government and the Marseille police headquarters, like an earthquake! The deaths of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia and Louis Barthou subsequently had serious consequences. I strongly advise you to take a look at the avenue du Maréchal Franchet d'Esperey which is not very far from here, it is not very well known in France, it was during the First World War very active in the Balkans alongside the Serbs against the Austro-Hungarian Empire within the Army of the Orient. He received the rank of Vojvode of the Yugoslav army (pronounced ""Voïvodé"", which means ""Duke"", and which is the equivalent of the rank of Marshal in France). [A small clarification, when you look at the monument from the front, to the left of the horse in the foreground you can see King Peter 1st, on the horse his son King Alexander 1st of Yugoslavia and to the right of the horse is in the foreground Marshal Franchet d'Esperey].  Opposite 4 photos taken on the internet via Google and Google Maps for delivery here: you can see the model of the monument in question, the call for donations for the construction of the 2 monuments in Paris and Marseille signed by the Marshal Franchet d'Esperey, the commemorative plaque of the place of the assassination in Marseille in front of the Bourse du Commerce on rue de la Canebière and the monument erected in Marseille rue de Rome just in front of the prefecture of Marseille where King Alexandre 1st of Yugoslavia expired.",6 years ago,2024-12-27 21:33:19.883417,5.0,Alexandrine Colombe Céleste,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111628357954067211158/reviews?hl=en-GB
