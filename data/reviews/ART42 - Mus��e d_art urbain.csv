ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqN2JpdURREAE,"It's a concept 😅. A school that is not a school.  A museum...which is not a museum.😲  Wander around the establishment with the guide while the students work on their computers or interact.  Quite confusing all the same, we are afraid of annoying or we are even a little embarrassed but if they say that they are used to it 😅.  Otherwise beautiful works, I'm sharing some photos so as not to spoil everything. Of course not all street art artists are represented - remember that this is the collection of Nicolas Laugero Lasserre - but as an admirer of this art, we learn a lot during the guided tour as well as from from the guide as well as from the visitors (there were experts!!). 🤩",8 months ago,2024-12-28 16:08:26.082816,5.0,Doris M.,439,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114245965856025659309/reviews?hl=en
