ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwOXFDenN3RRAB,Great majestic synagogue! They can improve on the Shabbat service! They never brought the torah by the ladies section. The Kudosh cookies(6 boxes!!); the way they were presented in their own boxes do not match this grand place! Better off with only the wine blessing. Spending the least €500/week for flowers and food catering would do this place some justice!
