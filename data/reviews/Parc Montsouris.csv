ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMejZYeTRBRRAB,This is a really nice park where you can bring your dog on a leash. It's a pity they don't allow dogs off leash here during specific times in a specific area as it really is enormous. This is ideal for people with children as there is heaps of play areas. Lots of little cafes as well.

Located in the 14th arrondissement, it was officially inaugurated in 1875 after an early opening in 1869.

It is also home to a meteorology station, a cafe and a guignol theatre. The roads of the park are popular with joggers on weekends. Parc Montsouris is bounded to the south by Boulevard Jourdan and the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris (CIUP), to the north by Avenue Reille, to the east by Rue Gazan and the Rue de la Cité Universitaire and to the west by Rue Nansouty and Rue Émile Deutsch-de-la-Meurthe. Cité Universitaire station on RER B is located in the southern part of Parc Montsouris, where it connects to Île-de-France tramway Line 3a.  EtymologyEdit  ￼  People in the Parc Montsouris in 2022.  According to the official website of the Park and other sources, the name of the park came from an old windmill, called the Moulin de Moque-Souris, which in the 18th century stood not far from the park site at the crossroads of rue d'Alesia and rue de la Tomb-Issoire.[3][4] Moque-Souris (""mocks-the-mice"") was a common name for windmills in France at the time; it was a facetious name, suggesting that the miller dared the mice to find any grain inside. The name over time changed from moque-souris to Montsouris.[5]  Another possible origin of 'Montsouris' is common with the name of a former principal roadway, today's rue de la Tombe Issoire: after leaving the city to the south, it passed through a Roman-era cemetery that had fallen into disuse from the 4th century,[6] and it may have been one these abandoned tombs that an influential 13th-century writer declared to be the burial place of ""Ysoré"", a defeated giant of popular legend.[7] No matter the veracity of the story, many of the area's landmarks had taken the 'tombe Issoire' name by the 18th century,[8] and if 'Issoire' emerged from 'Ysoré', 'Montsouris' could be a 'mont Ysoré' that evolved over time.",a year ago,2024-12-28 17:06:51.079299,5.0,Mekan Nuriyev,67,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110944985878489729613/reviews?hl=en
