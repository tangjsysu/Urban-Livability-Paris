ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIajg2R2VBEAE,One of the prettiest parks which has such a lot to offer in terms of nature and experience. There are a lot of plant and animal species here. Although the animal habitat looks a bit underwhelming(not enough space for animals I feel). I highly suggest this place for spending some quality time with friends or family. Y'all can also pay a visit to the Natural history museum which houses some interesting animal specimens.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIall6NHJnRRAB,A lovely zoo that is clean and peaceful.  Good value for money. However the cat house made us sad as was way too small no room to run and so was the primates. One of the snakes was also cramped. The other animals apart from a few birds had plenty of room. If they could improve this it would be a lovely place for the animals. You can see the red pandas up close (not sure if this is a good thing for them).

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOUpiVmRBEAE,"About the animals:  Having been built in the late 1700s (one of the oldest zoos in the world that is still open!), it was clearly built for human enjoyment rather than the animal's well being. The monkeys have no space (the orang-outangs build their nest at a hight of 30m, the cages are no more than 10m tall) and just sit there. The felines pace around their inclosures or sleep. The birds fly from one side of the cage to another.  This zoo needs serious replanning especially since it is in a city as touristic and important as Paris.  Also the excuse of ""they would go instinct without us"" is not a good one. The animals are no better miserable than extinct.  Appart from the cages and the animals:  - A LOT of the inclosures were empty (probably due to it being winter?). - The souvenir shop is extremely small. - The infrastructure is clearly outdated and in poor condition.  Good things about the zoo:  - The staff was nice. - The terrariums with snakes and insects was absolutely great. - The zoo is clean. - The price is reasonable, although a little much for the experience. - The location is great.",a year ago,2025-01-24 14:12:28.917117,2.0,Jude Whittaker,212,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107167472524686691038/reviews?hl=en
