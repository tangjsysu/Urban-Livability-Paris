ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQeHM2Z29nRRAB,"Horrible experience - not recommended. We visited the restaurant today just to say hello to some friends who had reserved a table to celebrate an anniversary. We arrived at the end, and we didn‚Äôt see the host, but the waiter saw us arriving. We asked to take another chair to sit for just a couple of minutes. He didn‚Äôt say anything against that, so we took the chair. Five minutes later, I ordered a hot beverage. Everything was fine until the end. When we started to pay, I informed them that I wanted to pay for the beverage. The host, who was really rude, tried to charge me the full price of the brunch. After confirming that my boyfriend didn‚Äôt order anything, she let us out of the restaurant with a really rude attitude. The entire celebration was completely ruined because of her attitude.

I actually saved it as a souvenir :) The plate I choose was Medaillon de Parguit, and I must say it was really taste, and nicely cooked. It was accompanied with a potatoes portion on the side and as you can see very elegantly presented. My only criticism is that, it was a bit of a small portion for a meat plate.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxMmN6WWZREAE,"My partner and I decided to do a pre fixe New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner at the restaurant. What started off as a nice evening quickly turned into the slowest dinner service I‚Äôve ever experienced.  We waited nearly 90 mins between our appetizer and main course. My partner‚Äôs entire meal was cold, and barely a slice of beef. We had to leave to ring in the new years elsewhere without dessert, to his credit the waiter provided a discount, but I still felt very unsatisfied and regretted booking here. The menu price for two was 240 euro, it felt like robbery.  The silver lining is we commiserated with nearby tables about their equally horrendous wait time and had a bit of laughs between.  The gentlemen next to us had been waiting 3 hrs for dessert. Needless to say I will not be considering the hotel for any stays based on the complete failure of the dinner service at the restaurant.",a year ago,2025-01-24 12:34:08.536006,1.0,Sai Dahari,29,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107191454646046049017/reviews?hl=en-GB
