ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0Nlo3UkpnEAE,"The good: Fun place to visit, also with kids. Dress up in medieval clothes and playing old games is cool. Very helpful and friendly staff (which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 3). The bad: not a lot of stuff to see. Some games, a documentary film, walking around the the tower, 10 minutes of looking at old clothes and weapons and that's it. You could probably do it in under an hour.
