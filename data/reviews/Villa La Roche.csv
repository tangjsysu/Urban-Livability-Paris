ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIaThpb0F3EAE,"A wonderful hidden architectural gem in Paris. If you are a fan of Le Corbusier‚Äôs work, I highly recommend visiting if you get the chance. A particularly good activity for a rainy day!  Very close to the metro station, allowing for easy access.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3emVIVERBEAE,"We tried to visit the Maison la Roche with my husband and my one and a half year old todler son. Everything was very unpleasant. Arriving is difficult and badly signaled. The ticket selling when you arrive is unprofessional. But the worst of all was the discrimination we suffer for going with our son. We bought the tickets and we were ready to start the visit when a woman (who refused to provide her name or role) arrived. She told us that baby prams were prohibited. Our son had just fell asleep so we didn't want to wake him up. So, we decided to visit the house by turns. My husband was waiting in the hall, but this woman said that they had to wait out on the street where it was very cold, because the prams were prohibited in the whole building including the hall, where we already were.
