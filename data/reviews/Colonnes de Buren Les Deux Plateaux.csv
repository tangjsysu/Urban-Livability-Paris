ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1a0lHYnBnRRAB,"In 1986, the Ministry of Culture commissioned the sculptor Daniel Buren with their creation to adorn the Cour d‚ÄôHonneur of the Palais-Royal. The 260 columns are made of white Carrara marble from Italy and black marble from the French Pyr√©n√©es. All columns take root in the basement and emerge outdoor in different heights, creating a particular rhythm, and giving an unusual contrast with the classical architecture of the surrounding Palace.  During the Colonnes‚Äô design and installation, intense debates ensued about the suitability of integrating contemporary art with historic landmarks. It was called a ‚Äúrude gesture,‚Äù an ‚Äúintellectual absurdity,‚Äù a classless ‚Äúchessboard‚Äù and ‚Äúlicorice sticks.‚Äù The debate was similar to those over the Louvre‚Äôs I.M. Pei Pyramid, the Centre Pompidou, and myriad other sites.  Petitions were launched to attempt to halt or destroy the installation. Graffiti desecrated the site. Left and right wing factions battled. Mitterand demanded that the project proceed as planned. In the end, he won and the art work was installed.",2 years ago,2024-12-28 15:03:36.442044,5.0,Matthieu ALHURAISH,245,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112823569053374900692/reviews?hl=en
