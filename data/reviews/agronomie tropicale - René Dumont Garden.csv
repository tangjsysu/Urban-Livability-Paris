ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIcjlXaXZnRRAB,A place with a connection to an event that fascinates me. The 1931 Paris colonial exhibition. There are also memorials to various peoples who served and fought and died during the First World War and a variety of buildings that are intended to capture the character of different parts of the then-colonies of France. Lots of bird life and a peaceful setting to visit. Recommended.,4 months ago,2025-01-24 13:46:15.042871,5.0,Brynley H,25,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114432454759937647069/reviews?hl=en-GB
