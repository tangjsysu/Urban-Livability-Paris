ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURicjVxNzF3RRAB,"We had a great experience at the cheese museum. We have been to one in Amsterdam before so decided to try this one in Paris while here for the Olympics.  We had a fantastic guide who was so knowledgeable, friendly and welcoming. My partner is blind and sometimes it's hard to find activities that she doesn't get bored with or feel excluded from with not being able to see but our guide was explaining things brilliantly and he brought out different items for her to feel. He was even kind enough to let her feel some cheese, after a thorough cleaning of hands, that was in the process of being made so she could understand and feel what he had been talking about.  We got to then try some yummy cheese at the end of it. There is a good selection of cheese, meat, and other products for sale too in the shop which had lovely, friendly and helpful staff.  Glad we popped in now, thank you.",4 months ago,2024-12-28 16:12:14.136197,5.0,kez davies,54,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118195182475921795910/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNidV95UExBEAE,"Fabulous experience! They have options for French and English tours which is nice. We were taught the regions of France where cheese is made and why. Also, how do other factors such as weather, the milk, process, etc affect the type of cheese. Most interestingly, we learned that a lot of cheeses are named after the family, much like wine, such as Emmental and Cantal (my favorite). At  the end we tried four types of cheeses and my favorite was the Brie with truffle - délicieux! A great cultural experience - I would go back.

This isn't a negative, but don't in expecting a museum. My guide was extremely knowledgeable and passionate.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYak83X3FRRRAB,"Very disappointing place. Expensive and unprofitable. Save your money. Calling a place a museum is really ridiculous. This is a cheese shop with a back room with explanations. Tours are offered in French and English. I arrived with my family at the place, and there was a tour in French, since I speak basic French, I inquired before the tour if it would be possible to ask questions during the tour and I was told yes. The employee who promised that if I spoke basic French, I could manage. He also added that he was the one doing the tour, and that he would speak slowly. In practice, another employee did the tour, spoke quickly, I couldn't ask any questions, and my family and I stood there ""like idiots"". After about fifteen minutes we left and asked for our money back, an unreasonable sum of 70 euros, as mentioned for a back room in a cheese shop. The employee who made promises was no longer in place, and another employee stammered. I asked him to contact the manager / owner of the place, and after an unpleasant phone conversation with the manager, he refused to return our money and dared to say that he was not ready to lose on us. I didn't understand what there was to lose if the tour was carried out (for quite a big group of people) and didn't depend on us, and the fact that we abandoned it about fifteen minutes after it started. Bottom line - save your money, unnecessary and expensive.",2 months ago,2024-12-28 16:12:14.138197,1.0,Dafna Yurista,207,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115210179265440691577/reviews?hl=en

Tours are in English or French depending on timing, so you might want to buy a ticket in advance unless you’re perfectly bilingual. The tour takes about an hour and the guides encourage questions. The space is small but the people are friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about educating people on the history of cheese across the millennia, the French cultural heritage of cheese, the wide range of cheeses still being produced today, and efforts to preserve this aspect of France’s gastronomy.  It is a very special place and they offer a cheese tasting as part of the tour, plus you can buy cheeses and cheese-related items in the gift shop.  What a gem!
