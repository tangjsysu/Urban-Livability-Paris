Before you get onto the football grounds, there is a quick ticket check & only ticket holders can go to the stadium.  There were quite a few food trucks & there was also a dj.  The pre game atmosphere was so awesome.  There was a PSG cut out photo opportunity where stadium staff offered to take pictures of us.  There was also a young lady giving out badges of the game. Getting into the stadium was really easy.  Once your scan your ticket & go through the gate, security pats you down.  My only issue is that there was one female security guard and 3 men. So my son had to wait 15/20 mins because there was a long line of females waiting.  We stopped to grab a drink & some popcorn.  The drinks were served in commemorative souvenir cups.
