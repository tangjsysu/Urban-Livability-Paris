ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3cDZfYTFnRRAB,"La Villette is less of a green park and more of a cultural space with playgrounds, the science center, a food hall, trails, and more.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2bUwydHRRRRAB,The science museum had mixed reviews but I don't understand it. The exhibitions were great! You can spend a full day here or maybe 2! Everything was updated with info from 2023 Space X achievements. It was amazing to see inside a submarine.  It was easy to book the timeslots online. There's a restaurant and kiosk and even burger king on ground floor. The only downside was that the planetarium show was very informative but completely in French. I thought it would be more visual so the language wouldn't matter but it was still nice.,a month ago,2025-01-24 14:22:42.669352,5.0,cherie touchard,72,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109535782254826108270/reviews?hl=en-GB
