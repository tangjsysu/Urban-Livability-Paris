ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwcVpMWlZREAE,"Excellent monument commemorating American citizens who volunteered their services to France prior to the United States of America's official engagement in the Great War.  The stone sculpture shows French and American soldiers welcoming each other in front of a winged Victory. The bronze statue of an American soldier is based on the likeness of the poet Alan Seeger. Living in Paris when war broke out, Seeger enlisted in the French Foreign legion in August 1914. He was killed in action on the Somme in July 1916.  On both sides of the monument are quotes from Seeger's poems and the rear is a list of over 100 American volunteers killed during the war, most whilst serving with the Foreign Legion, the Lafayette Squadron and the American Field Ambulance Service.  The monument is position next to the square Thomas-Jefferson in the  place des États-Unis. The metro station Georges V is about a 5-10 minute walk.",5 years ago,2024-12-27 21:28:38.912598,5.0,Simon Abercrombie,341,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110013211564253233670/reviews?hl=en-GB
