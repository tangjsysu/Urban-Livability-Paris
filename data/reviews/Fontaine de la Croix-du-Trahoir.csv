The fountain of the Cross of Trahoir It was built by Jean Goujon for the first time in 1529 on the initiative of François I on the rue Saint-Honoré side. It takes its name from the place where, until 1739, the ears of unscrupulous servants were cut off. A gallows (the dry tree) and the wheel were erected there for a long time “to serve as an example to passers-by”. It was rebuilt in 1606 then moved in 1636 because it obstructed traffic on rue Saint-Honoré. Left without maintenance, it fell into ruin when in 1775 the architect Germain Soufflot was tasked with rebuilding it. He placed it in a polygonal building and entrusted Boizot with the sculpture of the nymph which appeared on rue Saint-Honoré. The Croix du Trahoir fountain has been listed in the inventory of Historic Monuments since February 2, 1925.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtcVpXem1BRRAB,"Very beautiful period creation which stands out in the middle of all the buildings if your gaze is willing to linger there...!! The crossroads where the streets of l’Arbre Sec and Saint-Honoré (I) intersect was once very busy; the place where capital executions and tortures took place (in particular the blowing reserved for the ears of indelicate servants) until the end of the 17th century. A torture wheel, a gibbet (the dry tree) and a cross (the Tahoir cross, a name from the old French designating a “drawer” that was pulled out when selling fabrics in the local shops) were there. The cross which was destroyed during the Revolution was intended for the tortured to say their last prayer before their torture. At the time of the Fronde, this sector where a sedan chair station was operated experienced strong tensions: arrests, barricades and repressions... A beautiful place to see in Paris which takes on its full dimension if we imagine all the executions which may have taken place there; which, at that time, was a show that we went to see with the family...!",2 years ago,2024-12-27 21:18:19.412058,5.0,Fred Booker,496,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115485660678768601234/reviews?hl=en-GB
