ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBM1lmZ21BRRAB,"Of the 24 meters high, 66 meters long and 34 meters wide, only three rows of stones remain of the majestic Freedom Tower. Well hidden in a quiet garden, the remains of the foundation of this building are among the last stones still visible from the famous Bastille prison. Placed in the middle of green vegetation, the founding stones of the Liberty Tower adorn the lawn of the charming little Henri Galli square. Within the fortress, this tower was magnified on the western side of the famous jail. Ordered by King Charles V, the latter was built by Hugues Aubriot in 1370. It is still possible today to observe its large conical base, 10 meters in diameter. Almost forgotten, the Freedom Tower resurfaced in the news on April 13, 1899. During the construction of metro line 1, the foundations of this tower were discovered under rue Saint-Antoine. The three circular rows of stones, erected one on top of the other, are dismantled and reconstructed identically in Square Henri Galli. Of this place of history and legend that was La Bastille, all that remains are the foundations of the Liberty Tower, a piece of the wall of the counterscarp of the moat in the Bastille metro station and the well-known route of the fortress made of square cobblestones, on the square of the same name.",7 years ago,2024-12-27 21:03:48.088838,4.0,Jean-Francois Y,369,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113217138316165473780/reviews?hl=en
