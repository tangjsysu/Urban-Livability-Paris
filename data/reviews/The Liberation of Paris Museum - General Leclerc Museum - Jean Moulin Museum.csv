It‚Äôs beautiful, rarely crowded, and the material is far more important and timely and fascinating than any parade through tunnels of ancient bones.  This museum offers a humbling and visceral reminder of the troubling politics leading up to World War II, the reality of German occupation, and the tragedy of the French government‚Äôs willing surrender of its Jewish citizens, both adults and children, to the concentration camps.  You get an inspiring and deeply curated look at those who gave their lives to fight the Germans. But this museum is also a sobering reminder of how quickly France fell ‚Äî and of the devastating consequences.  Entrance is free, but you‚Äôll want to book a spot in the (also free) tour of the underground operations center used by the French resistance.

The museum focuses on two different men who were key to Frances involvement: LeClerc, a military general and Jean Moulin, who was very active in the resistance. I wasn't aware of their roles & the museum did a very good job telling their stories, in the bigger picture of Paris during the liberation.  The museum's lower level is a former air raid shelter which was used as the resistance headquarters during the last year of the war; you can visit that at no charge, but space is limited and there are 100 steps up & down so take that into consideration.

It's one level down from the main entrance and you'll see it at the end of the walk through. If you'd like to go in to the bunker you'll have to get a ticket at the entrance when you first get in to the museum. There's a standard viewing and a virtual reality one which you have to follow one of the resistance personally around the bunker as he goes through certain procedures. That's about 45 minutes all up.

My only complaints are A) several rooms in the bunker are very empty, such as the telephone room. Some props, displays, or artifacts, like in the air filtration room would be fantastic additions.  B) the touch screen computers are excellent and add lots of context, but are bottlenecks for visitors, maybe a second monitor at each station, or a QR code to access the info online would be helpful; and  C) The ""Repression"" section when you first go down stairs felt like the exhibits and videos weren't quite in line with the section's focus.
