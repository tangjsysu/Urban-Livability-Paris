Many masses during the day either in French (for the most part) or in Latin, and confessions all day long, with an average of two priests. Often a lot of queues at confessions during ""peak hours"", that is to say around noon, and from 4/5 p.m., and therefore a lot of waiting which can sometimes go up to 45 minutes (and therefore even sometimes it is not possible to confess because it is too late). In off-peak times we wait on average 10 minutes.
