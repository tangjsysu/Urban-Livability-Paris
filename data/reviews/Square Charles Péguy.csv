ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZOWIybVlnEAE,"This is a little gem and very underestimated. You can walk through Paris for several kilometers in this former highline, that is now transformated to a highline pedestrian park (like In New York) where you will enjoy beautiful flowers and green plants, while walking high above the streets with great views over the different Boulevards and surprisingly quit considering the traffic beneath. Excellent for a run as well. About midway there is a public toilet and also an outdoor crossfit area with bars to do pull-ups, sit-ups, dipps and so on. There are benches along the way.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z0lDcHV3RRAB,"A charming hilly square divided into two spaces: a steep shade garden and a sunny garden housing children's games.  The shade garden is laid out like an undergrowth. In the shade of a soothing foliage of birches and hornbeams, shrubs and shade-loving perennials flourish. Hydrangeas, ferns and pachysanders have a field day offering a magnificent shades of more or less tender greens.  Surrounded by august catalpas and fertile lime trees, the sun garden charms us with its colors during this summer period.  Cosmos, cleomes and honeysuckle offer you a dance as fragrant as it is colorful.  At the exit or entrance to the square, depending on your direction of visit, don't miss a spectacular double massif. Sages, marigolds and petunias combined in a beautiful white-purple accord, we will thank you for your visit.
