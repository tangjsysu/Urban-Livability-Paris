ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncHZmQW93RRAB,I watched 4 exhibitions so far and it is always a pleasure to come back. I can't tell which one was my favourite but I can recommend the museum for no matter which age!:),7 years ago,2025-03-15 22:06:19.418311,5.0,LenaReh,57,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111241048240615572768/reviews?hl=en-US
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnM3B5OUFREAE,"Yes, I'm a little biased, I'll admit it. I work with Aardman in the United States. But... when I walked into this Museum in Paris and saw the layout of this exhibit and saw exactly what they were exhibiting, I couldn't have been more excited. There were actual sets from their films and commercials. They had early sketchbooks on display from the 3 founders from many years ago. They showed you how lighting makes a difference on the set. It went on and on. I could have spent 5 hours there and I already know their work.  Great layout. Great exhibit.",9 years ago,2025-03-15 22:06:19.418311,5.0,Yi Jian,226,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107720693328277357629/reviews?hl=en-US
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBdUlxbmZREAE,"The Walt Disney exhibit gave me the giggliest warm fuzzies a girl in her thirties could have :) To be fair, I watched these movies enough growing up that I could recite every word of Beauty and the Beast and most of Lady and the Tramp long before I was 10 years old, but I really loved the exhibit in any case :)",8 years ago,2025-03-15 22:06:19.419313,5.0,Shalla Hanson,9,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107129382771430195705/reviews?hl=en-US
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBNC1EREN3EAE,"One of the best new museums in Paris, with a seeming focus on what I will affectionately and proudly call the geek graphic arts. Recent expos have covered the art of Pixar, Marvel Comics (and cinema), Miyazaki, and England's Aardman Animation (Wallace and Gromit!). Terrific curation, a nifty space, and a Deine location that is easy to access...don't hesitate!",9 years ago,2025-03-15 22:06:19.420313,5.0,Kory Kessel,92,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100088323468859763384/reviews?hl=en-US

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncGRLck93EAE,"We went there as a family at lunch time on Saturday. .. no waiting and not very busy, in short, ideal. .. Great exposure, the price is therefore justified very beautiful works, superbly presented.  Only downside. .. For this subject, children often accompany parents... And nothing suitable for them... design a little booklet for them?  Thank you because this is the second time we have come and it is always quality",7 years ago,2025-03-15 22:06:19.427403,4.0,Julie Banse,301,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114633861973561701559/reviews?hl=en
