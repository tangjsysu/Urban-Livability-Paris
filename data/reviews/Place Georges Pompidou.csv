ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNieWFXWm1RRRAB,"Disgustingly rude personnel. You won‚Äôt want to pay for this. The restaurant was almost empty but we were offered a dusty table in the middle of the restaurant.

No options to take at all. We decided to leave and that wasn‚Äôt a problem, but as we were leaving one of the staff sent us an extremely rude gesture.
