ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzaG9Ud0t3EAE,"The statue of Julius Cesar (100 - 44BC) is located at the western end of the Central Alley near the Octagonal Basin in the Tuileries Garden. The original was the work of Nicolas Coustou around 1707 and was erected here in the Tuileries Garden in 1722. That statue was later moved to the Louvre and replaced with a replica that you see today.  What you see is a classical depiction of Caesar as a General and Emperor with armour, cloaked and with crown on his head. Sword & shield at his side while he holds a scroll in his right hand. Interestingly, the statue is situated just across the Alley from a similar classical depiction of Carthage General Hannibal which was created as a pair and erected at the same time.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 11:02:49.201589,3.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en
