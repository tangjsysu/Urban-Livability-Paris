ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMU03VXNBRRAB,I just attended service for Holocaust remembrance Day. The cancer was amazing and sadly I couldn't stop crying. Is very touching ceremony and it was very interesting because there was no rain during the ceremony and when the ceremonies stopped the rain started to pound like it was hitting you. Felt like it was some kind of divine intervention. Very powerful to be in Paris on Holocaust remembrance Day. The French were with their Vichy government. Shameful and disgraceful.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtM0luYmh3RRAB,"This important museum tells the story of the Jewish community in France and particularly in Paris, the deportation, the collaboration of the french regim , the police, the church but also the civilias in the ilimination of the jews in France. There were also those (small group of french non Jewish) roughly around 1,500 of angels who were willing to risk their lives for their fellow Jewish neighbours. They did not follow other antisemites who portrayed jews as bunch of monsters that should only find their bitter end in the infernos. Thank you so much for your bravory.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzOG95ZWdnRRAB,"We happened upon this place while walking around Paris on foot (I saw it on the map). It's a free Holocaust museum. The exterior is pretty interesting, with the star of David pattern. You have to go through mild security to enter, but I believe the whole museum is available free of charge. It's quite extensive inside. We didn't have a ton of time to spend, or we probably could have stayed longer. As it was, we were probably in there for a good two hours. There's tons of material inside, and all the written displays were in English as well as French. The video and audio presentations were only in French, as to be expected. I actually learned a lot about the impact of World War 2 in France.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnNFlyYi1RRRAB,"Touching Experience: ""Shoah"" is Hebrew term for ""destruction"", and this museum is dedicated to the victims of such catastrophe.  I had been to the entrance of the museum 3 times and every time, I just could not make myself go inside it. I spent almost 3 hours inside the museum and afterwards I was drained emotionally, the whole place leaves you exhausted and the people who went through this, my heart went out to them.  Oh man, why you do this to your fellow beings! Take time to go through it, some of the videos are so moving, it is difficult to even see the entire piece. And then there is hope at the end of it all, hopeful recollection from the survivors, from the people who helped them. To go through this kind of experience and not have even an iota of bitterness towards others, only a GREAT human being can achieve this. Respect, I salute to the resilient human spirit.
