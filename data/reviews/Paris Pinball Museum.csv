Whether you are an experienced collector or just an amateur fan of pinball, this pinball collection must be among the best assembled. I count myself lucky to have had the chance to visit.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3dE4yWmRBEAE,"You've got to make a reservation by emailing Raphael, but he'll treat you right and you'll likely have the whole place to yourself.  So many machines, there's no way you'll be able to play them all. Other than the Monster Bash machines, the newest machine is from 1978. So if the electromechanical machines are your bag, you'll be in heaven.  Even more interesting are the ancient machines from the 30s. They're all still playable, and so much different from pinball as most of us know it.",6 years ago,2025-03-15 22:21:37.592738,5.0,Don Phillips,22,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117823450536123764535/reviews?hl=en-US
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5MjhhTmNREAE,"A truly remarkable collection of vintage pinball games, dating back to 1931. I’d recently read a book on the history of pinball with our daughter, and this museum brought that history to life for her in the flesh. No flippers? No problem - plunge and nudge. The original curator of the museum passed away in late 2022. It’s being managed with love by a volunteer and the curator’s son - and it’s a real treat to get to play these vintage games. Entry is on Saturdays by appointment only - check the website for details and plan ahead.

You pay 15 euros and have 220 machines to have fun with. When I was there, most machines were from the period 1930-1960, still there were some from the 70s, one from the 90s and three brand new.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVa0tURzVnRRAB,"This museum is amazing. Raphael and Bruno literally opened the museum for us and accommodated our schedule. This museum is Raphael's life's work. He's been maintaining and restoring these machines since the 1960s. When you enter the museum and see the hundreds of perfectly maintained, vintage pinball machines and arcade games. You'll be in awe of what he has preserved. Raphael spent some time giving us a history of his place. He's a fascinating person whom I could have spoken to for hours, but he wanted to ensure my family had enough time to play the games.  My family, with 2 young boys, played non-stop for hours, and we had the whole museum to ourselves . . . while millions of tourists in Paris typically queued to take photos in front of statues. We felt guilty.  You should go if: - You have appreciation the mechanics of 20th century gaming - You have children who need to channel their video game addiction into something new - You looking to out-instagram your friends (the colorful pop of these machines is amazing)  and most importantly: - You love playing unlimited pinball (on perfectly maintained vintage machines)  This collection is an absolute treasure!",5 years ago,2025-03-15 22:21:37.597884,5.0,Sam Keninger,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108469796150147620232/reviews?hl=en-US

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNHBMQnJRRRAB,"Five stars, nothing less! And if I could give ten, I would! This private museum is unknown to almost everyone, including many pinball lovers. And for good reason, Mr. Lankar, its boss and founder, does not seek to advertise too much. The result is that it ""filters"" the visitors a little and ensures that they do not take the place for a simple games room, but for a temple of electromechanical pinball. With my friend Frank M. (creator of the comic book character ""Lucien""), we spent several hours there! The games from the '30s and early '40s are not the most fun, it becomes interesting from Humpty Dumpty from 1947 and its first ""pinball machines"" which allow you to control the ball.
