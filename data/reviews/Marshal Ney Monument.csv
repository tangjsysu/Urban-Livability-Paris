ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzaktTRWVBEAE,"Michel Ney, Duke of Elchingen, Prince of Moskowa (Sarrelouis, 10 January 1769 ‚Äì Paris, 7 December 1815), was a French general, Marshal of the Empire under Napoleon Bonaparte. An energetic fighter, endowed with a great offensive spirit and indomitable character, after distinguishing himself during the French revolutionary wars, he took part in most of the Napoleonic wars, distinguishing himself in the Ulm campaign, at the Battle of Friedland, in the Spanish war and above all in the of Russia; during these campaigns he always demonstrated combativeness, personal courage and tactical ability. With a difficult and irritable character, Ney, after having passed to the Bourbons after the first abdication of the emperor, returned to Napoleon's side in the Hundred Days and fought in the Battle of Waterloo. Considered a traitor after the Second Restoration, he was tried and shot. For his contribution to Napoleon's victories, he had received the honorary titles of ""Duke of Elchingen"" and ""Prince of Moskva"".",2 months ago,2025-01-24 11:49:26.998337,5.0,daniele pedroni,"1,726",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106356302369543242970/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxd2VyVzN3RRAB,"Beautiful tribute to this brave man. I don't understand how a film or series has not yet been made about the life of the great Michel Ney. I have made a pilgrimage from Argentina to greet the ""Red Lion"", as P√©rez-Reverte does every time he goes to Paris. The excellent books ""The Second Life of the Marshal"" (in Spanish) and ""Courage Marshal Ney"" (without Spanish translation) would make fantastic scripts for a movie. Producers be warned!!!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLLUt6bjJRRRAB,"Beautiful statue which well represents the image we have of Marshal Ney, saber in hand, haranguing his troops in battle...! The history of the Luxembourg Palace was strongly marked by the trial of Marshal Michel Ney, Duke of Elchingen, Prince of Moskowa, accused of high treason after his rallying to the Emperor Napoleon who landed from the island of Elba, in March 1815, when he declared to King Louis XVIII that he would bring the usurper back ‚Äúin an iron cage‚Äù. Marshal Ney was judged there expeditiously and lived out his last days there, before his execution, in the early morning, on December 7, 1815, avenue de l'Observatoire. This statue is located near the site of his execution!!
