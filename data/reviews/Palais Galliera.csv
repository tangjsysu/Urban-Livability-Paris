ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzMGRtNkhREAE,"Excellent, small museum! Around 1 hour I think is enough, but totally worth the price. We were incredibly lucky to visit when the Stephen Jones exhibition was on, which was brilliant. A huge collection of his work, expertly laid out and with music to boot.  The history of fashion is also good - nothing that will blow your mind but good pieces and plenty to look at. Definitely recommend this for any fashion minded visitors to Paris, and far surpasses the meagre and disappointing YSL museum",a month ago,2024-12-28 15:56:48.347213,5.0,Tigershout,261,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113225536009475713146/reviews?hl=en-GB

There is a free app that give English and French audio and text/transcript for select pieces in their collection. It‚Äôs interesting and worth listening to.
