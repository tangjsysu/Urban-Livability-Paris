ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtd19tOEN3EAE,"Apart from the lovely people at reception (thank you again for their kindness), deplorable experience at the Passport service.  On a day of total strike (zero metro), I had the misfortune of arriving 12 minutes late compared to my scheduled meeting time (12:30 p.m.). I was received by an extremely unpleasant person, who told me that in principle, she will not take me because I am 12 minutes late (I took my ticket at 12:42 p.m.) and that an appointment is supposed to be last 15 minutes. (This was the lady at counter 9, on November 10, on duty before 1 p.m.) She therefore refused to process my file, even though there was no person before or after me. I still waited 15-20 minutes in the waiting room, seeing that there was still no one there, I tried my luck again by going back to see her: still not, for a question of ""principle"" . I can therefore only note that in addition to being unpleasant, this person simply did not want to work, and that she is simply paid to do nothing (in any case, I witnessed 25 minutes without any appointment, what bad faith).  In short, I had to make an appointment in several weeks, because of an incompetent and lazy person, who hides behind so-called ""principles"", so as not to do his job. When I think that it is part of our taxes that pay him a salary, I find this distressing. If anyone from the town hall reads this, I can only recommend a good cleaning of the workforce, it will do good for French society.
