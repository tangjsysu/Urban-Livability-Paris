ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2XzZYTUZREAE,"Went for a visit not knowing what to expect. I knew Moreau is the king of symbolism in France. There are 3 levels to visit : his living places and two floors with a ton of his paintings. Very crowded walls in the rooms ; paintings can be unachieved as well as totally completed. Very often the Greeks are represented: Jupiter, Salome, Hercule, Pasiphae‚Ä¶  200+ paintings  It is interesting but I am not fond of. The lights or the bl√¢m√©es of the paintings are a surprise , sometimes too dark or too bright but he makes his point where he wants us to focus. Interesting museum and definitely worth a visit if the 2nd floor huge room that is really impressive",a week ago,2024-12-28 15:51:20.312723,4.0,Jerome G,"1,108",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110577902389001766319/reviews?hl=en-GB

You first go through Moreau's home with its rather small rooms crowded with art and artefacts. Then you go up to the studio and it knocks the wind out of you by its size. Huge space with huge paintings. Such an impressive space. The works shown are in various stages of completion, some of them mere sketches, it gives the whole collection such a variety. You can almost picture the artist in his work process. I also really liked the case with his painting tools, so intimate and touching.

I went on a weekend morning with a friend which was lovely because it is located nearby a gorgeous neighborhood with lots to offer. When you first walk up you‚Äôre entering Gustaves apartment adorned with his art as well as art from others, but it‚Äôs not until you go upstairs from the apartment that you really get to take in all of the amazing large pieces this artist created. The gallery space alone is amazing, the staircase is of course grand as pictured; but the art is some of the most relatable and impactful art I‚Äôve seen maybe ever. A symbolism artist whose art still speaks to life‚Äôs lessons, challenges and theories.
