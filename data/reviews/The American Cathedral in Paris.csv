ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURldnV1dGVBEAE,"Most unwelcoming church I've ever had the misfortune of setting foot in and that is due, in large part, to one Mr. Jeb Seder, the Cathedral's very own Canon for Development, ironically. We were in Paris for Fashion Week and the Cathedral agreed to host an event in which we were showing. From the moment we arrived at the church, and were greeted with Mr. Seder's abundance of disdain, we were made to feel wholly unwelcomed. He was exceedingly rude, disturbingly confrontational and was even overheard shouting, ""Kiss my a$$, lady!"" to a guest. To say the least, it was shocking to witness such behavior - without any provocation meriting such a response - from a church official. This is clearly not the right position for this man and I am further shocked by the fact that he is the chosen representative of the church to the public. Absolutely inexcusable. He should be promptly removed from the post as he is an absolute embarrassment.",2 years ago,2025-01-24 13:19:16.199729,1.0,elk312,22,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113037353437941768458/reviews?hl=en
