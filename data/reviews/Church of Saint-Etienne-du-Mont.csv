We were lucky enough to be there during the Sunday service—it was wonderful, and we enjoyed the hymns and the sound of the organ.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvbmM3TFpREAE,"This is a delightful church building in the 5th District just behind the Pantheon at Place Sainte Genevieve. It is well worth making time to see before or after your visit to the Pantheon.  The church history dates back to the Abbey of St-Genevieve which was constructed nearby in the 6th century during the time of King Clovis I. The original Saint-Étienne church was constructed here in 1222. However, it had to be enlarged and reconstructed several times in later centuries.  The building you see now dates back to the the end of the 16th century. It is French Gothic and French Renaissance in architectural style and is quite beautiful. The exterior includes a decorative facade and single narrow tower.  Perhaps more impressive however is the interior of the church. What you'll find is a traditional Gothic nave with high vaulted ceiling, an impressive wooden pulpit, stained-glass windows, wall frescos as well as a charming rood loft with almost whimsical spiralling staircases on both sides. The side chapels are delicately decorated and also worth spending time to enjoy.  In the end, Saint-Étienne-du-Mont is an interesting church to learn about historically and to view if you plan to spend time in the 5th district on the Left Bank. You can easily combine a visit here with that of the Pantheon and Musee du Cluny which is also nearby.",5 years ago,2025-02-09 15:29:11.133267,4.0,Brad,"5,639",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en

The only thing you need to keep in mind is that the church does not always allow visitors or tourists, especially during their services and other activities. Therefore, in case you are unlucky, and in a hurry to visit it quickly, you might not be able to do so.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkME9tdU9nEAE,"During our family visit to Paris in October 2023, we had the opportunity to explore the Church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, and I would rate it four stars. Nestled next to the Panthéon, this church offers a captivating ambiance, enhanced by the glorious light filtering through its stunning stained glass windows. The play of light creates a truly magical atmosphere, adding to the allure of the place.  One of the remarkable aspects of the Church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont is that admission is free, making it accessible to all visitors. This inclusivity allows everyone to experience the beauty and serenity of this historical gem without any barriers.
