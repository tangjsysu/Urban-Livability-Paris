ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvOWU3UkJREAE,One of the most interesting things to see at Place des Vosges in the Le Marais is the equestrian statue of King Louis XIII. The original was created and erected here in 1639. However it was destroyed during the French Revolution near the end of the 18th century. A new marble statue was created by Jean-Pierre Corto and installed here in 1829.  What you will see is a depiction of the king in the manner of a Roman emperor riding through a crowd of loyal subjects. He is wearing a cloak and laurel wreath upon his head. His left hand is bent and rests near his chest while his right arm is extended. The horse appears to ride steadily forward.  It is a nice equestrian statue and worth paying a few minutes to enjoy if you plan to visit Place de Vosges and enjoy seeing monuments and statues during your travels.,5 years ago,2024-12-28 17:01:53.930027,3.0,Brad,"5,430",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIX3ZFTxAB,"Emblematic square of Paris in the heart of Place des Vosges. Henri IV (1553-1610) undertook numerous works in the capital. One of his most notable achievements is this very first place Royal. It is characterized by its square shape, the symmetrical layout of the buildings whose construction, new at the time, combines stone, brick and slate. The square was inaugurated in 1615 by Louis XIII (1601-1643), on the occasion of his marriage to Anne of Austria (1601-1666). A bronze equestrian statue representing him adorned its center in 1639. The central land formerly used for a horse market became in 1682 a fenced garden shaded by lime trees. It was destroyed during the French Revolution and the equestrian statue melted. Reconstructed in the 19th century, the square combines large lawns punctuated by four fountains, works of the sculptor Jean-Pierre Cortot (1787-1843), all crowned with rows of lime and chestnut trees. A marble equestrian statue of Louis XIII, made by Cortot based on a model by Charles Dupaty (1771-1825), has been installed in its center since 1829. The square was renamed Place des Vosges in 1799, after the name of the first department to pay tax under the Revolution.",3 months ago,2024-12-28 17:01:53.931026,5.0,Laurent Padou,850,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102878442016850755868/reviews?hl=en-GB
