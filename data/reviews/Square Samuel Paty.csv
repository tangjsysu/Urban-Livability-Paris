ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdHZmY2hBRRAB,"Square Paul-Painlevé is located just outside the important Musée de Cluny. Originally created in 1900, the square was redesigned in 2000 to resemble a museum garden centred around the medieval theme. Opening hours are around 9am to 6 or 7pm depending no the season.  This square is rather tiny. What makes it interesting are the numerous monuments placed upon its grounds. These include the She-wolf of Rome, the fountain monument to Octave Géard, a contemporary bust sculpture of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes as well as the Michel de Montaigne statue.  You can conveniently browse Square Paul-Painlevé in 10-15 minutes before or after your visit to the museum.
