ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiaE4yd29nRRAB,Best customer expirence I had the last years. I contacted Church's to get the buckle of my belt changed because it was scrateched. A few days after my request the team from the Chruch's boutique called me (and also wrote me an e-mail) to arrange everything. They kept my updated of everey single step. Many thanks to Fatima and the rest of the team. After six weeks I received my belt with a new buckle and it was free of charge in this case. If you need some excelent shoes or a nice belt visit this store.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJZ2VXN2d3RRAB,"My visit to the boutique on rue Saint Honor√© took place on Friday, November 16, 2018. In the boutique, 2 advisors and 1 salesperson. As soon as I arrived, I immediately felt the salesman's denigrating gaze. Of course, I didn't have a pair of shoes on my feet, just a pair of casual sneakers. However, I didn't think my outfit would earn me this bad experience. Clothes don't make a monk, remember what you're looking for. In the store, I asked the seller if he had the Oxford Tricolor model in blue, and he replied word for word ""yes, we have it"". I asked him if it was only on order because I didn't see it in stores; immediately the seller replied ‚Äúwe have it in store, the pair is upstairs in stock‚Äù. INCREDIBLE, the seller doesn't even ask me to see it. After telling me that they had the pair in stock, he said to me ""I'll let you enjoy it"". All this because... I wasn't dressed ""properly"" but know that my pair of sneakers are worth more than most of the shoes on sale in the store. That evening I was hesitating between a Berluti and a Church's. Result, thanks to an unpleasant, unfriendly welcome at Church""s, I immediately went to get a pair from Berluti.

The seller assured me that the size and width were perfect (this is exactly the size I bought from Church 15 years ago without ever having a problem).
