ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3a0wtcDV3RRAB,"A bridge across the River Seine in the 4th arrondissement. It links the √éle de la Cit√© with the √éle Saint-Louis. The present bridge is the seventh to link the two islands since 1630. The pont Saint-Landry (1630‚Äì1634) was the first of these.  In 1717 a wooden bridge was rebuilt, with seven arches, and named the ""Pont Rouge"", due to the colour in which it was painted. It was destroyed in 1795. In 1804, under the direction of the engineer Dumoustier, a new two-arch bridge was built, 70 m long and 10 m wide, and mainly in oak. It was demolished in 1811, and a suspension bridge replaced it in 1842. Twenty years later, this was replaced by a metallic bridge, with a single arch with a 64m opening. In 1939, this one was demolished. In 1941, it was replaced by a ""passerelle"" resembling an iron cage. In 1968, the present bridge was begun, and inaugurated in 1970.",5 years ago,2024-12-28 15:15:08.158888,5.0,Edward,"1,627",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117088487949573398219/reviews?hl=en-GB
