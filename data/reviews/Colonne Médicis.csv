ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNcC1DUXFnRRAB,"At first glance, an oddly solitary Doric column standing beside circular building of the former commodity exchange, the Bourse de Commerce (which Jefferson once called the most splendid thing on earth; it’s currently under renovation). This column had a specific purpose for Catherine de Medici, the widow of Henri II,  who had it built in 1575, connecting to her grand home (hotel particular), the Hôtel de Soissons. It was to be used by her personal astrologer, who succeeded Nostrodamus when the latter left Paris. It is the sole vestige of the Queen’s former grand home here. There are about 150 spiral steps leading to the top, whose four corners correspond to the cardinal compass points. How different it must have appeared amidst its 16th century surroundings. We only passed by this column.",5 years ago,2025-01-24 11:31:52.748182,4.0,joyce ycasas,2,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110230313364886806250/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxcE5mSy1nRRAB,"Medici column attached to the stock exchange 2 rue de Viarmes Paris 1st. Hollow Doric column (1574 Jean Bullant) on the order of Catherine de Medici in the courtyard of the Hôtel de la Reine which she had just had built. This column would have served as a point of observation of the sky for Como Ruggieri, astrologer to the Queen. It must be believed that the tower benefits from magical or other protection, legend reports that on stormy evenings a long black silhouette would appear thanks to lightning in the iron cage. The work Mont Analogue (2001 -2020) by Philippe Porreno, installed at the top of the column, is a transcription in colored signals of the eponymous novel by René Daumal. Echoing this installation, the artist offers an application that reacts in real time to each color variation by associating it with a sound. Daumal's original text, first transformed into a color code, returns in sound form, like a possible ghost of the book.",3 years ago,2025-01-24 11:31:52.748182,4.0,BUSCA GIAM,405,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104988806245298693464/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDaFlYOEVnEAE,"Attached to the Bourse de Commerce, a tall column seems very incongruous in the Parisian landscape. It is one of the most mysterious monuments in Paris. A Latin inscription at its base mentions that this construction is the only vestige of the hotel built in 1572 by Catherine de Medici, on the site of a hotel owned by Louis d'Orléans. The queen had this 31 meter tower built for her astrologer, Cosimo Ruggieri, who had a great influence on her. This ""dark man, who had a well-shaped face, who played instruments, sometimes had round shoes, always dressed in black"", regularly climbed, in the company of his protector, to the top of the tower, to wall up formulas there. magic and read the future in the stars. The upper cabinet, to which access is via a spiral staircase of 147 steps, was once entirely covered with glass roofs; All that remains is a simple metal carcass open to the winds. The exact function of the building remains unknown, but each angle of the capital of the  tower marks one of the cardinal points. After Ruggieri's death in 1615, the column fell into disuse. The hotel, which became a gambling den where pha raon and lansquenet were played, was demolished in 1748 to pay the creditors of its last owner, Amédée de Savoie. The column narrowly escaped destruction, and was sold in 1750 to the City of Paris, which installed a fountain there - now dried up - and a sundial.  If we think of the upheavals that have occurred in the neighborhood over time, we must believe that the tower benefits from protection - necessarily magical. Legend has it that on stormy evenings, a long black silhouette appears, thanks to lightning, in the iron cage.",4 years ago,2025-01-24 11:31:52.748182,4.0,olivier JAN,194,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108909132748791016687/reviews?hl=en-GB
