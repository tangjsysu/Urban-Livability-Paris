It is the largest crypt in Europe and includes archaeological discoveries made during excavations in the 60s and 70s.  This crypt offers a unique perspective on urban and architectural evolution in the île de la Cité, the historical heart of Paris.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5LTR1a0J3EAE,"There are surprisingly few ancient archaeological sites to visit in Paris, which makes this museum a rare and interesting place to visit. Most of the ruins are from the later years of Roman Lutetia, when the Île de la Cité was notably smaller than today, and include the remains of the old quayside and the late Roman bathhouse. However, there are also medieval cellars from subsequent houses, and displays on the importance of the Seine to the city’s growth and development.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvenZlSkdnEAE,"The Archaeological Crypt of the Parvis Notre-Dame (Crypte Archeologique) is located on the main square in front of Notre Dame and provides visitors a rare glimpse into Paris’ distant past. The site, discovered during excavations between 1965 and 1972, features ruins of the Gallo-Roman town called Lutetia, which rest beneath the surface of the Notre Dame Square. Entrance is €6 per adult and the attraction is included as part of the Paris Museum Pass.  Some consider this one of the most important archaeological sites in France, if not all of Europe, due to the relatively well-preserved building foundations, walls and other vestiges of the Gallo-Roman town of Lutetia, the precursor to Paris. Evidence of later structures from the middle ages, all the way to the 19th century is found at the site. In all, this 2200 square meters of various homes, bathhouses, shops, seawall and other ruins to be seen at the crypt.  In addition to the actual ruins, they make good use of interactive technology, providing visual displays of what the ancient city would have looked like. Further computer simulations provide glimpses into Notre Dame itself during various phases of its construction during the 12th to 14th centuries.  Overall, we very much enjoyed the Archaeological Crypt, finding this attraction well worth 30-45 minutes of your time before or after visiting Notre Dame Cathedral. Those with a interest in ancient history or ruins, will want to add this attraction to their list of must-see places to visit when in Paris.  Hint: The entrance to the crypt is found at the front of the main square, while facing the cathedral.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6cTR6cDRBRRAB,"This was a very nice and interesting diversion during our recent trip to Paris. My wife and I actually didn't know that it existed, but we saw it when we visited Notre Dame, decided to go in, and paid for our tickets at the front.  I came out knowing much more about the history of the area and the architecture than I did before, so that is a ""win"" in my book. It may take you about an hour or so to move through, but it's definitely worth the money.  I should also mention that the staff were literal Heroes that day. When we went to a cafe shortly after visiting there, my wife discovered that her purse was missing from her backpack. At that point, if it hadn't been pickpocketed (would NOT have been an easy feat), there were only 2 places where it could possibly have been. It wasn't at the first (down at a spot on the Seine), so we went back to the Crypt, with our fingers and toes crossed. It turns out that she had left the purse at the ticket counter. The staff found it and kept it safe. One of the gentlemen working there even tried to seek us both out on social media to tell us, but neither of us use social media. But, we got it back safe and sound, which was a massive relief. It wouldn't have been the end of the world if it was gone; luckily her passport was not in there. However, it still would have been a MAJOR headache to get a new driver's license and cancel credit cards, not to mention the loss of a NOT insignificant amount of Euros.
