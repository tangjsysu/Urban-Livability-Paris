ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4LU5EX2pRRRAB,"My family of 5 (twin 9yo and 5yo) got to the pool at 1145 to investigate. It opened at 1200 but then there was a slow queue. For the 5, because we weren't local, it cost €13.60. Quite reasonable. Lots of staff milling in background (I think the security mentioned in other posts). Went through fancy turnstile. Lovely clean changing area and loads of lockers with clever locking mechanism. Got into poolside and was told I couldn't go in because of my shorts (not speedos or jammers) they were quite tight but not tight enough and we all had to wear a hat. A ran back to reception, purchased jammers €14 and swimming cap €4 for my egg like bald head (luckily my missing link body hair did not need to be covered!) and rest of family were given lost property hats. Finally in water by 1226. Went to go outside - that is why we were there, pictures of natural pool and slides looked amazing! It was shut! Only open on Wednesday evening and weekend. The indoor pool water was too cold for my 5yo but we tried. Aqua cycling class looked fun. Wife did some lengths. I managed 6 before we had to leave as pool was closing at 1330. Had nice shower and shower gel and back to nice changing rooms and quiet reception.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNad1lTNU1REAE,"Im writing the experience in detail for you all. Hope you find here what you need. 1st, on hot weekends, it gets so crowded, and there is a long line, so you better arrive earlier than opening time to save your spot. Almost the first 70 people will be waiting in an area where there is a mist sprayer spraying water every 10 mins. But the rest will be under direct sun. 2nd, you have to have your swimming cap for entering the pool. There are also restrictions for bathing suits. Be sure to check them on their website. 3rd, you are allowed to bring food and drinks inside. 5th, you have to carry 1 euro for having a locker. The locker gives you back the 1 euro when you wanna leave. If u forget to bring a coin, you can ask the reception for a chip that ressembles the 1 euro. 4th, there are strict rules when you wanna get close to the pool which are understandable, u cant carry anything with you, not even a towel, but you can leave your belongings in the grass close to the pool where its safe. If you are wearing glasses, they will let you enter with those, but not with sunglasses. 5th, do not count on their shop inside. It doesn't have a variety of foods or drinks to offer, just coca, sprite, juices... and sandwiches... also, no alcoholic drinks are sold. 6th, you can only smoke in the designated area. 7th, staff are really kind and helpful. They are doing their job protecting us, not stopping us from having fun! 8th, it's really clean! The forced shower before entering the pool is necessary for maintaining the cleanness and people have to respect that. It really is a very nice experience spending a day there! Thanks to the nice people.",a year ago,2025-03-15 23:05:40.993065,4.0,Abi Moghani,91,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117478827828576060964/reviews?hl=en-US

On the other hand, the regulations as well as their application really need to be reviewed in my opinion! Too many rules, most of them abusive (obligation to take one path rather than another, ban on photos in the direction of the large pool, ban on sunglasses in the pool and others, etc.) About the application there is a way of talking to people, the staff seems to train like in the army! Orders rather than dialogue, too much anticipation of transgressions, we really have the feeling of being watched over our slightest actions. No explanation is given, we ban that's all. The atmosphere becomes stressful, we no longer know what we can or cannot do. So really average for relaxation and fun. I suggest writing down all the rules on the site and at the entrance this will certainly avoid the annoyance of some customers. I also suggest reviewing the way you approach customers.

I advise everyone who plans to come there to come during opening hours and not at the end of the afternoon. I was lucky to come across a day with an average attendance with zero queues. The rest area is small but looks great for a picnic. Some locker rooms are broken and the €1 cupboard lock system for backpacks was a bit strange but it wasn't that restrictive. The pool was okay. We have so much fun there that we don't really notice the time passing. Many lifeguards are present to ensure the safety of swimmers. There are some superb slides, a little scare and a little water in the nose the first time, but it's insane!

Pleasant outdoor pool. Only problem is that normally the capacity of the swimming pool is 1200 people but with covid they are only allowed to admit 200 people, arriving at 2:45 p.m. I waited 40 minutes to be able to enter because you have to wait for swimmers to come out . The health protocol is respected as soon as you return you have to put on hydro gel, the place costs 1.50 euros I think it is due to covid. Wearing a hat is obligatory. On site you can rent a deckchair and eat a sandwich, fries, drinks or ice cream. Only the outdoor pool is open, the changing rooms and lockers are outside. As soon as we arrive we are given a large plastic bag with a disinfectant locker token.
