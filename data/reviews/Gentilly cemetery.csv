ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtb29mM0V3EAE,"If you arrive at the cemetery via rue du Val de Marne, no watering cans are available on a Sunday morning before 10 a.m.... It seems that they would be at the entrance on rue de Ste Hélène. For a very elderly person, imagine the journey.. Otherwise, generally positive maintenance of the cemetery and thanks to the municipal employees...",2 years ago,2024-12-27 19:59:08.229591,5.0,Jean-Pierre DESCAMPS,686,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100723990920065231168/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtLUlTWFNREAE,"I spent my early childhood going to water, grandfather, my little cousin, Uncle Léon, the family that I loved without having known them. Then one day in November, I followed a hearse with dressed horses and crowns bigger than me. The master of ceremonies said that the first class was really superb, I was desperately looking for Grandma Germaine, I had seen him ""sleeping"" in his bed, I didn't understand anything... She was always laughing, when the convoys passed in front of the house, telling me ""they are going to the party, there is always one who has more fun than the others and he stays there"". When I got home I realized that she had stayed at the party. She was 50 years old, it was in 1951, I have never mourned this beautiful and sweet woman.",2 years ago,2024-12-27 19:59:08.230591,4.0,Paulette Gentil,69,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107940690915392995759/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCX2MzN0dnEAE,"Cemetery not easy to access. An entrance where you cannot park, otherwise it is impounded. For someone with reduced mobility, and if you are loaded with plants, it is not practical. You need a badge to enter by car... Located on one side of the ring road, with a Roma camp who burn plastic each time they visit, on the other side the Charlety stadium with its clamor on match days. No florist nearby. Bring a bottle of water, often not a watering can. Abandoned, sad, because of its geographical location, I imagine. Not a place for meditation.",a year ago,2024-12-27 19:59:08.230591,2.0,Corinne Fouveau,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102423175949874454299/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4a09ES2NnEAE,"This place is a shame, an insult to the deceased. From a set that could be beautiful (slope, trees, walls in good condition.....), a completely neglected place, not maintained, left abandoned by the brilliant - communist - municipality of Gentilly which does not respond to any asks, has nothing to do with this place, lets the common infrastructure (concrete, sealings, slabs on the ground, trees, etc.) deteriorate, closes the water pumps, removes the watering cans, etc......The result is one to shudder with sadness. Half of the tombs are abandoned.  The immediate environment is repulsive on the west side (adjoining gypsy camp in particular), particularly for what adjoins Gentilly itself. It is not just a matter of financial scam for those who paid concessions, but of morality and dignity.",a year ago,2024-12-27 19:59:08.230591,1.0,J F,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110881969042769487126/reviews?hl=en-GB
