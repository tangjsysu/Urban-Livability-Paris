ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURUOGFIam13RRAB,"Incredible museum due to the variety of works present. Only the Munich Museum rivals it in terms of famous painters.  On the other hand, the Mona Lisa room is so crowded with people that the works of Titian and Veronese are not easily visible due to the Mona Lisa traffic jams. What a monumental error on the part of the museum curators!! When I see people rushing to the Mona Lisa then leaving for the other room without even looking at the works of great masters, which are nevertheless right next to the Mona Lisa, it pains me.  Signage needs to be reviewed, no display of the room number in too many rooms, people are lost and look haggard at their map trying to find their way. If the Mona Lisa is highlighted, signage could be installed for other works by the big names in painting.",7 months ago,2024-12-28 16:05:47.445758,4.0,Amandine GBB,202,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114229894452028751334/reviews?hl=en
