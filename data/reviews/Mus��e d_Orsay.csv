ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzNzY2V0pREAE,This is a great museum. It has many beautiful and famous sculptures and paintings. The building is also very beautiful. You will find famous Van Gogh paintings too It will take around 2 hrs to visit the whole museum.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2NXREUXRnRRAB,"Why anyone would give the Musée d'Orsay anything less than a four or five star review is beyond me. This is one of the great French museums, and while it may not be on a par with the Louvre in terms of its art collection, there is much to see and marvel at in this cavernous building.

Housed in a beautifully restored former train station, it offers an extraordinary collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces. From Monet and Van Gogh to Degas and Renoir, every gallery is a feast for the eyes.

The clock windows provide stunning views of the Seine and Paris, adding to the charm of the visit. The staff is friendly, and the audio guides enhance the experience with rich insights.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzalpPQm5RRRAB,"Whoever had the vision to transform this old train station into a museum deserves serious recognition. The collection is vast, so plan for at least 4 hours. Trust me, even that feels rushed.  A little tip: sprint to the Impressionism section the moment you get in, which should be 9:30 opening time. At Vincent Van Gogh’s self-portrait, it gets busy really fast.  Now, let's talk about the space because this isn't just any museum. The architecture itself enhances the artwork, allowing it to truly shine. The way the building's design supports both navigation and the art experience is simply brilliant.

Ample rest places and bold pieces, it was a truly enjoyable experience for me.  The Van Gogh self portrait and lots of other prominent pieces are housed here.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3dE0tVHZRRRAB,"We visited the Musée d'Orsay in the last week of August 2024 and had a great experience overall. However, one tip for other visitors: avoid purchasing ""skip the line"" tickets from third-party sellers, especially if you're planning to visit on a weekday morning. The crowds were lite during our visit, and the line for on-site tickets was minimal, so the extra cost for those tickets wasn't worth it in our case. The crowds may vary seasonally, but this is something to keep in mind if you're visiting during a quieter time.  As for the museum itself, it's very well organized. It’s also quite kid-friendly, with elevators available throughout the building, making it accessible for strollers and wheelchairs alike. There's a large cafeteria inside too which we haven't tried but seemed reasonable priced based on a quick glance on the menu.  While the museum is much smaller compared to the Louvre, you can comfortably explore it in 2 to 3 hours. We started at the top on the 5th floor, where the oldest paintings from the mid to late 1800s—particularly the Impressionist paintings —are housed. As you work your way down, you move through post-Impressionist works, which often depict older historical events but were painted later.  Overall, it was a lovely couple of hours spent surrounded by incredible art in a more intimate and less overwhelming setting than the other larger museums around there",4 months ago,2024-12-28 15:45:15.234183,5.0,Hareesh Gottipati,115,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115214256391567328093/reviews?hl=en

I love the way all of the exhibits are laid out so spacious with plenty of room to wander and to get beautiful photos as well.
