ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuckxHcGRnEAE,"Haudriettes hospital, towards Place de Grève The congregation was founded by Jeanne, the wife of Étienne Haudry. While her husband was on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, Jeanne, believing him to be dead, gathered at her home several pious women, with whom she took a vow of perpetual chastity, and devoted herself to religious life, for the service of poor. When Stephen returned, he obtained that his wife be released from her vow, on condition that the pious association could keep her house and be provided with sufficient capital to support twelve poor women. By a charter of April 1306, Philippe le Bel authorized Étienne Haudry to “build a chapel on the place he had newly acquired at La Grève, closely related to the hospital for the poor that he founded”. This hospital was located at the corner of the old rue des Haudriettes and rue de la Mortellerie (these two streets were abolished in the 1830s when the Paris town hall was expanded).Étienne Haudry founded a chaplain and his sons founded three others. The statutes of the Haudriettes were approved by Cardinal Nicolò da Pisa, legate of Pope John XXII, and later confirmed by several popes. In a bull from Clement VII, it is indicated that the hospital accommodated thirty-two widows. In the statutes from 1414, the hospital was administered by “hospitable women” presided over by a mistress.  The congregation gave its name to rue des Haudriettes (and by extension to the Fontaine des Haudriettes) in the 3rd arrondissement because it owned houses there.  For the rest, go to Notre Dame de l'Assomption in the 1st Arr. and take the opportunity to see rue Cambon in its entirety. It's worth the trip.... there are so many things to see and know in this street.",3 months ago,2024-12-27 21:06:24.109080,3.0,Zeus PARIS,125,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117253810512552359246/reviews?hl=en-GB
