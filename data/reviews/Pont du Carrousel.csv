ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNudXBDMDV3RRAB,"Pont du Carrousel is an elegant bridge in Paris, connecting the Louvre Museum to the Left Bank of the Seine. Its understated yet graceful design blends seamlessly with the surrounding architecture, offering beautiful views of both the river and the iconic landmarks nearby. Walking across the bridge provides a peaceful and scenic route, especially during sunset when the city’s monuments are bathed in golden light. Whether you’re heading to the Louvre or simply enjoying a stroll along the Seine, Pont du Carrousel offers a serene and picturesque experience in the heart of Paris.",3 months ago,2025-01-24 12:15:17.905461,5.0,ARMAN Rez,150,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107828181732355401156/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYeGVYS0JnEAE,"Despite the original bridge being completed in 1843, this construction dates from 1939. It was realigned to direct traffic and pedestrians to the Carrousel in the Louvre after which the bridge is now named. Uninspiring to the eye, it is the history that facinates. The four statues, two at either end, were designed by the same artist, Louis Petitot (1794 - 1862). They were originally installed on the bridge in 1847 and were replaced on their pedestals when the bridge was strengthened in 1908.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 12:15:17.906458,5.0,Mike Day,337,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101631451196518773367/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNXVqbnZnRRAB,"As I walked across the Pont du Carousel, I was struck by the breathtaking views of the Seine and the surrounding landmarks. This bridge is truly a marvel of engineering and design, and I couldn't help but feel awed by its beauty.  The Pont du Carousel is a must-see attraction for anyone visiting Paris. The bridge is well-maintained and offers a comfortable walking experience. The ambiance is serene, and the sound of the river flowing beneath the bridge is simply mesmerizing.  One of the things that sets the Pont du Carousel apart from other bridges in Paris is the unique views it offers. From here, you can see the Louvre Museum, the Eiffel Tower, and Notre-Dame Cathedral all in one glance. It's truly a photographer's dream come true.  I have no complaints or criticisms to make about this place. I found it to be an incredibly enjoyable and peaceful experience.  As for improving the place, I can suggest to add some benches along the bridge for visitors to sit and enjoy the view for a longer period.  I give the Pont du Carousel Paris a five-star rating. It's a special place that captures the essence of Paris and provides a memorable experience for visitors. I would highly recommend this attraction to anyone visiting Paris.",a year ago,2025-01-24 12:15:17.911459,5.0,Reda Haddou,515,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114553008799835481583/reviews?hl=en
