ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfaWJEeVhnEAE,"A city beneath a city. This underground network is filled with tunnels and chambers. The tunnels get really narrow in sections, so it helps to carry your backpack on your front. The bones are artfully arranged in this chilling memorial. The catacombs were originally created to solve overcrowding in cemeteries. Originally these tunnels were limestone quarries. The passages are dimly lit and the stillness of the tunnels create an otherworldly experience. Then there are the legends of secret gatherings. Beyond the macabre, the catacombs invite visitors to reflect on mortality, and the passage of time. There are poetic inscriptions etched on the walls. Scientists like Antoine Lavoisier, the father of modern Chemistry may also rest here. Visiting this place was like stepping into a time capsule.",a week ago,2025-01-24 14:10:15.106999,4.0,bartika dutta,400,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110716269415563247425/reviews?hl=en-GB

The tour lasts about 1 hour and you can go at your own pace once inside! You are given an audio guide that is used like a phone and throughout the catacombs you can tune in to hear different amazing facts about what you are seeing.  If you have a disability that prevents you from walking or are claustrophobic this might not be the one for you!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzanFTZXR3RRAB,"I was very eager to get to visit the place. And it did did provide me with a very good experience. First thing first - there is no need to pe absolutely precise for the ticket hour. Our was for 10:45, we went there at 10:30 and we were able to get in. The Catacombs have a 200 people capacity and when reached you will need to wait. Second it is free for journalist. You need to provide a valid Press card and you will be admitted. Third - do not bring backpack of any kind. There are no storage rooms, the entrance is one kilometer away from the exit. The space is narrow and at some point you will have to wear your backpack in front, so taking photos with camera will be hard. Also there is an audio guide that is very interesting. Also the souvenir shop is very cool. A lot of books and other cool souvenirs to buy. I do recommend. PS the tickets are named, but none is looking for this. If you by mistake buy a ticket for another day, as it will show you the next available time in the site, and not the day you want, you can sell it without any issues.

Amazing history, experience, civic planning, artistic reverence, very unique and bizarrely beautiful Parisian tourism. And it’s been open to visitors since 1809, incredible!  You must buy tickets in advance. Probably a few days in advance. Very easy to do online. At the moment (November) it is low season and it was still two days in advance. Visits are in timed slots so you go through in relatively small and spaced out groups. Everybody gets an audio guide included in the cost, that guides you through the history and each special space. It’s very easy to book tickets online and good information provided on the website, including the QR code ticket to your email.  I’m glad i finally made it. Fascinating to learn about the extensive network of tunnels under Paris, over 300km!! I highly recommend to visit the free WW2 Liberation museum across the boulevard, also explaining another history of the Paris tunnels and life in WW2 under occupation.

And be sure to buy from the official website...I have heard there are fakes out there. Our entry time was 10:45am. We walked up at about 10:40, went through the security line quickly, declined the audio tour, and started walking down the spiral staircase. They only let 200 people down at a time, and there is a digital display on the wall right before you descend, keeping track. DO NOT underestimate the physical part of this. The stairs going up and down are not for the faint of heart. It can easily make you dizzy, and obviously, it is just a plain physical strain going up and down. Plus, the path down below is uneven, slick, and cramped. Do not go down if you're claustrophobic or over 6 foot 2 inches.

You are deep under Paris here! Interesting to learn about the history of Paris, quarreling, subsidence and issues with cemeteries to add to the landmarks, architecture, culture and cafes. You travel away from the entrance and come up away from where you went in, so be prepared for a short walk back. The first part is a bit service tunnelly, but then you get to the mausoleum part and the weight of the presence of history and solemnity vastly increases, be prepared to be in the close presence of the remains of millions of humans.
