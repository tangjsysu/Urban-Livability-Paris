ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUeU9LemdnRRAB,"It's a nice place surrounded by a lot of trees. It's spring now & when the gentle breeze touches the greeneries, it's a treat to both the eyes & mind. There are two playgrounds one for the smaller ones & the other for the older ones. The playground where the small ones play has a boundary which prevents kids from different risks. There exists a fountain, water tap, toilet & some benches too. I could notice a small basketball court too but not sure if it's a part of the park or something private. Overall I would say, if it's a pleasant sunny day with gentle breeze flowing, you can definitely pay a visit to the park otherwise stormy or too windy weather may make it tough to stay there.",4 months ago,2024-12-28 17:08:25.574544,4.0,Tanzila Mohammad,15,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103469676666456092633/reviews?hl=en-GB
