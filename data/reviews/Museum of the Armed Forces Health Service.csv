ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjd5d0tnEAE,"The Museum of the Armed Forces Health Service is a fascinating and unique institution that showcases the history and evolution of medical services in the military. In several countries around the world, this museum is a must-visit for history buffs, medical professionals, and anyone interested in the intersection of medicine and warfare.  The exhibits in the museum cover a wide range of topics, from the development of battlefield medicine and surgery to the advances in mental health care for soldiers. Visitors can learn about the different medical technologies and tools used in the past, as well as the innovative approaches used in present-day military medicine.  One of the most interesting aspects of the museum is its collection of artifacts, which include uniforms, equipment, medical supplies, and even prosthetics used by injured soldiers. These artifacts provide a unique insight into the experiences of military medical personnel and their patients.  Besides its permanent exhibits, the museum also hosts temporary exhibitions and events that showcase current research and developments in military medicine. These events provide an opportunity for visitors to learn about the latest innovations in the field and to engage with experts in the industry.  Overall, the Museum of the Armed Forces Health Service is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the history and evolution of military medicine. Its exhibits and events provide a unique insight into the important role that medical services play in supporting the men and women who serve in the armed forces.",a year ago,2024-12-28 16:15:52.969115,3.0,Uzzal Roy,6,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115692914863786051614/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodDdyY1p3EAE,"This is quirky museum but one we enjoyed.  First, you have to find the place.  Go to the far end of the fence in front of the Val-de-Grace church and press button to get buzzed through the gate.  Then check in at the window where they held our passports during the visit.  I think it is somehow a military prooperty, thus the passport thing.  Fee was 5 Euro.  If you are interested in military history and/or the medical field, you will find it interesting.  Otherwise, maybe not.  But one of the best things was the access to the interior of the Val-de-Grace Church, not accessible otherwise.  We were basically the only ones in the museum and we had the church all to ourselves, which was magical.  It has a stunning interior.  So this alone made it worth the trouble of finding the place.  There were also clean bathrooms available, which is always appreciated in Paris.  Finally, don’t believe the Google Maps directions, which tried to take us through a chained gate from Blvd Port-Royal.  Enter from Rue Saint Jacques.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzaTl5Sk5REAE,"This is perhaps the strangest museum in Paris, not because of its content, just the whole thing. I have lived exactly facing the museum for a year, but aside from a sign it is impossible to realize there is museum there at all. Incredibly weird!!!!  It is as if the closed gates tell you, stay away and keep off and don't come back. The whole place says you are unwelcomed. Weird..  There is a very, very, very SMALL SIGN, written in French that says if you want to enter the museum you have to ring a bell. Then someone buzzes you in. Then you have to go to a guard, give an ID card, they will give you badge to wear, then you go and pay 5 Euro to get in... I must have walked by the place a million times wondering whether I should buzz  or not.. I don't know WHY they just don't keep the door open...Weird, Weird, Weird....  As for the museum itself..the entry fee is cheap, there is never a line and the museum is often pretty empty. I was the only person there. The collection itself is, as advertised, mostly medical history. So, if that interests you, it's a nice visit. See my photos. A lot of historical medical pieces. You can probably see the whole thing in 60 minutes. Would I recommend a visit? Only if you are in the area and interested in medical history. There is so much more to do in Paris though. Also remember the hours are very limited. It is closed on Mondays and Fridays..and on other days only from 12:00 to 6:00 pm. Maybe if they made the museum more welcoming more people would visit. People were nice though..A C-level place to visit.",4 years ago,2024-12-28 16:15:52.974115,3.0,Mehran MxM,415,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109037286554776832954/reviews?hl=en-GB

A banner reading ""Musée du Service de santé des armées"" hangs from the front fence.
