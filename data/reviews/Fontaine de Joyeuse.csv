ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVajRIVEJ3EAE,"ALL FOUNTAINS OF PARIS #allfountains of Paris JOYFUL FOUNTAIN ……………………………………………………………………… Walking along Rue de Tourenne towards Rue Saint-Antoine, not far from Place des Vosges, an attentive pedestrian, in a series of facades and doors, suddenly discovers a beautiful ancient fountain.  Around 1580, the residence of the first doctor Henry III, Mark Miron, and the Hotel La Joyeuse was located here. This mansion was a key site of conflicts in the late 16th century. A famous military man close to the king intervened many times during the conflicts with the Guises. In 1588, after strong pressure from the Estates General, Mark Myron was removed from the king.  When it became important to supply water to all residents in the densely populated Marais region, a fountain was built here in 1687, which took the name of the old residence. The architectural ensemble that we can see today dates back to 1847 and was completed as part of the water supply program for the Saint-Antoine region and its suburbs.  The fountain is an aedicule - a small niche in larger buildings, resting on a pedestal, topped with a pediment and surrounded by columns. The niche of the fountain, under the coat of arms of the city of Paris, really seems to have grown into the buildings, about 3 meters wide, open with an ionic arcade, in the depths of which there is a small cast-iron statue of a child holding a slanted vase from which water is pouring. The statue sits on top of a marble pedestal, with a shell-shaped shell, set in a semi-circular basin. It is this sink that the boy tirelessly fills with water. The pool is decorated with a bronze mascaron through which water is drained.  Inside, on the base it says “OURCQ”. Since the 1820s, the clean waters of the Urk have flowed into the capital thanks to new canals.  This new source of supply made it possible to obtain much more clean water than from the Seine. This fountain was no exception.  The vault above the statue is decorated with a bas-relief composition of various aquatic inhabitants among the reeds: herons, frogs, swan and snakes.  #fontainedeJoyeuse #paris3arrondissement #monumentthistorique #canaldelOurcq #IsidoreRomainBoitel #édicule #bas-relief #fountain #water in Paris #culdefour #canalUrk #Joyful fountain #MarcMiron #Mare #edicule #walk in Marais @antoinette_legrand",5 years ago,2024-12-27 21:11:00.572302,5.0,Antonina Vavrysh (Antoinette Legrand),111,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118315189010160545726/reviews?hl=en-GB
