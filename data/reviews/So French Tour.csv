ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURucXFYaWhBRRAB,"The tour of Montmarte in Pierre‚Äôs Citroen was the highlight of my recent trip to Paris. I absolutely loved every second of this 60 minute tour. Pierre‚Äôs is an excellent guide, driver and photographer!!! He speaks great English and provides live commentary during the tour. Oh and he plays French music which makes the drive very enjoyable. He stops and takes videos and photos at all the great spots. He is very down to earth and very knowledgeable. I highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Paris. I am looking forward to doing another tour of Paris in Pierre‚Äôs Citroen. Once again, thanks to Pierre for giving me an amazing experience on my holiday !!!!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2bUtQTEhnEAE,"I wanted to experience Paris differently on this trip and I'm so glad I booked this tour with Pierre. He was delightful and I could tell he enjoyed showing off Paris. He knows the city well, the history and pop culture anecdotes too. Communication before the tour was easy and on point so there was no confusion. I wasn't staying in Paris but meeting/pickup was no problem. He took great photos and videos of me throughout the tour as well! Pierre's enthusiasm adds to the enjoyment of the tour. It's great that he likes to throw in some surprises too. His Citroen is a character too -- loved all the looks and smiles as we drove around. The tour was tailored to me and that is a very important touch. Driving through the winding streets of Montmartre was wonderful! His soundtrack for the tour is so fitting too - if you love the magic of Paris, it is enhanced by his music playlist. I chose a time when the sun would set while we were driving, the city of lights came to life!",2 weeks ago,2024-12-28 16:30:24.938617,5.0,Abigail Ekue,10,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103160547358774203504/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQbDlxeUR3EAE,"Bottomline: BOOK THIS TOUR!!!! I visited Paris with my sister during the summer Olympics and booked Pierre's So French 4 hour tour of Paris in his orange Citro√´n.

He will take you all over the most picturesque parts of Paris (and even some hidden gems), including driving right along the bank of the Seine! (It's awesome!!) If you're on a time crunch and want to see Paris' greatest hits, Pierre will take you to all of them and even customize the tour for you (for example, we stopped at a bakery!)
