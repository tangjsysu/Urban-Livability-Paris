ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIazZUQmZ3EAE,"Huge rose bush in bloom, in June, in the gardens of the Port of Arsenal, Paris 12. The name of the place is due to an arsenal that was here between the 16th and 19th centuries. At some point, this arsenal was reinforced with two towers and a wall, which were added to those of the Bastille, and some moats. The current moat was created after the destruction of the Bastille, to replace the water channel that fed its moats with water from the Seine. In the 18th century, as part of a plan to clean up the waters of Paris, the Ourcq canal was built, which brings water from the river to the city. Then, it was decided to cross the city with a canal that would take that water to a good part of the neighbors: the Canal de Saint Martin, which also serves as a shortcut to the Seine, shortening the distance between Austerlitz and the Island of Saint Denis from 35 to 12. kilometers. And that canal ended here, at the Arsenal port. The port was very successful from that time until well into the 20th century There was significant traffic of goods through the canal, which ended up being unloaded here. Mainly wine, grains and wood. In 1983 it was decided to transform the port into a tourist port, and the traffic of goods through the canal has since been transformed into tourist boats, which continue to pass through it today. The last reform of the port was carried out in 2009.",4 months ago,2025-01-24 13:27:31.687947,5.0,jmtt vbgp,744,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104511820868043898884/reviews?hl=en
