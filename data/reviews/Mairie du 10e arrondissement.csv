At this location previously stood a municipal guard barracks which housed the municipal services of the district town hall from 1849.

In 1889, the project presented by the architect¬†Eug√®ne Rouyer¬†(1827-1901) for the town hall of the 10th arrondissement was selected in the competition launched for its construction. Rouyer is not unknown since he came second in the competition for the reconstruction of the Paris City Hall (burned during the Paris Commune) awarded to the architect Th√©odore Ballu. He was also inspired by the central part of the project he presented for the Town Hall.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbmM2Y01nEAE,"Good morning, The Town Hall is a very beautiful place. The security guards are respectful. The place is welcoming, but I strongly advise against the passport and identity card service. I went there yesterday, it was around 4:45 p.m. It must be believed that at this time, the staff is already doing nothing, and does not want to receive people. I was the only one in the department. As soon as I showed up, an employee asked me sharply to take a ticket. Which I did, and sat obediently in the waiting room. Meanwhile, the lady at reception, of black African origin, was telling her colleague what had happened to her with other users. She was very angry. There was chatter, chatter. This woman spoke very loudly, without caring about my presence. His colleague told him I was waiting. At that moment, she called out to me. ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù No hello Madam nothing; I told him that I needed information regarding the renewal of my identity card. She took a document, and made annotations, speaking in a very loud voice. When I wanted to ask her a question, she yelled at me, telling me that she had been explaining things to me 10 times, which was not the case at all. I asked him to stop yelling at me. And then she screamed again. So I raised my voice in turn. There his colleague, probably of North African origin, told me to calm down. I told him not to defend his colleague, who was at fault. She came out of the office and pointed to the exit. Which is very bad manners. I stood in front of her and said that it was inconceivable to be treated like this in a town hall. That they were paid to inform people. There she headed towards the exit door, to tell me to get out. The black African person in turn came out of his office, and stood in front of me, with a very aggressive posture. I asked her if she intended to hit me. She saw that I was not afraid, and so she returned to her office. Then when I started towards the exit, she came out and followed me, insulting me. I told her she didn't even know how to speak and so on. The discussion degenerated. Once outside, she opened the window and yelled at me, telling me that she was the one who was going to educate me.  It is scandalous to see the welcome given to us in a Town Hall. These 2 women obviously have no education or education. They forget that it is our taxes that pay them to inform users. They obviously know that they are not at risk of losing their position, and that they can be very aggressive with users without ever being worried. There are posters everywhere indicating that incivility is prohibited towards civil servants. But I think we should start by hiring polite and courteous people to serve users. That employees should be sanctioned for such behavior, as is the case in the private sector. Fortunately, after being attacked in the Town Hall, I returned to the businesses of Passage Brady, where the sellers spoke to me and gave me information with incredible politeness and kindness. Exchange of smiles by people who work very hard and don't spend their time chatting and criticizing customers. These Town Hall employees should go there to do a courtesy course. But as long as they continue to attack people without suffering sanctions, things are not going to get better. This is the problem of some Town Halls, fortunately not all, where there is no control, where laxity prevails. Users have no other choice than to go to a Town Hall, where the welcome is more serious, and where the Mayor is keen to welcome his users with dignity. Which, judging by the comments, is not really the case in this Town Hall.",a year ago,2024-12-27 20:56:25.795088,1.0,Celine Robert,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104962718744137841681/reviews?hl=en
