ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtN2NxajhnRRAB,"Enjoyed walking round which took approximately 40 minutes. Sadly, none of the exhibits were in English. A guided tour would have been better with an English speaking guide. Still worth a visit though if in Paris :-) Staff were very friendly and accommodating.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiMEp1RldnEAE,"Amazing museum with varied content. Free self-guided visit. There we find a blade from the guillotine and period documents from the French revolution but also from the German occupation, evidence on the cases of serial killers like Petiot or Landru, but also elements relating to the Apaches, bandits violent people of the streets, or the infernal machines of the anarchist attacks of the 19th century.  The evolution of the police and its resources is explained with costumes, weapons, various means such as dog brigades or modern drones. The history of the prefectural institution is also presented with curiosities such as autograph letters from Vidocq the convict who became an informer and substitute for the police.  The means of investigation of the scientific police are also presented with their historical evolution, from fingerprinting to the search for traces of DNA through the anthropometric description illustrated by the reconstruction of such a laboratory.  A part also concerns rescue, in particular firefighters, with a video on the fire at Notre Dame de Paris.  This museum being located in the police station which receives the public, our intention to go up to the floor of the museum without settling in the room or taking a call number was stopped abruptly by a man with a...policeman tone! After freezing for a few moments, we were accompanied by elevator shortly after by one of her colleagues who invited us to leave our belongings in a locker when we arrived upstairs. An affable man then received us to briefly explain the history of the museum before letting us visit freely. At the start, a person from the museum who was much more welcoming than the one at the entrance made us open the locker and take us to the exit.  This museum is interesting for anyone interested in the police issue in Paris and the evolution of society in terms of security. Obviously there is nothing concerning contemporary criminal events. But the latest means are well represented. The museography is a little old but quite acceptable. I was also surprised to find a prefect with my last name.
