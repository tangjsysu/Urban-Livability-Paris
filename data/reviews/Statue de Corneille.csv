ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYaHVINFlBEAE,This is a stone statue of French Pierre Corneille (1606-84) is situated just beside The Pantheon. It is the work of sculptor Georges Rispail (1952) replacing an earlier bronze statue of Corneille that was melted down during the Vichy Regime.  What you see is Corneille mostly covered by cloak and peering forward while clutching a manuscript in his left hand. It is an interesting statue worth a quick look-see if passing through the area and interested in monument viewing.,3 months ago,2025-01-24 11:35:07.563272,3.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB
