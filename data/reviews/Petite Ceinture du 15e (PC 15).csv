ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuMHJPcFVBEAE,"This walk is an element of the small ring of the 15th, accessible by a staircase via rue Leblanc. The Petite Ceinture, a 32 km railway line, was built around Paris during the Second Empire (1852-1869). The section from Place Balard to Rue Olivier de Serres was closed to travelers in 1934, but remained used by freight trains until the 1980s. Vegetation is gradually taking hold on railway structures, creating habitats conducive to flora and fauna. This railway and natural context that it is up to everyone to preserve favors the creation of this green space which has retained its original wasteland character while integrating into the urban fabric.",3 months ago,2025-01-24 13:14:59.960486,4.0,Laurent Padou,852,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102878442016850755868/reviews?hl=en
