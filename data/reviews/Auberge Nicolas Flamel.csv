ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmN2RIa25nRRAB,"We visited Auberge Nicolas Flamel for New Year’s Eve and opted for the five-course menu. The food was delicious, and the number of courses was perfectly sufficient to make for a satisfying dining experience. The service was also attentive and professional.  However, there were a couple of downsides that we’d like to point out. Firstly, the dining room was quite cold, and there was an uncomfortable draft around our feet, which made it hard to fully relax and enjoy the evening.  Secondly, there is no drinks menu available, which means you have no way of knowing the prices for beverages beforehand. We ordered tea, which was served in a teapot for two cups, but by the time it was poured, it was almost cold—likely due to how long it steeped before being served. When we asked for a fresh pot, the same issue occurred, and the tea was brought back lukewarm. To make matters worse, we were charged €36 for just four cups of tea (€9 per cup). If you’re going to charge that much for tea, it should at least be served hot. It felt very odd and disappointing to drink cold tea at such a fine restaurant.  Overall, while we enjoyed the food and the service, these issues with the drinks and temperature left us with mixed feelings about the experience.",3 weeks ago,2025-01-24 13:49:31.859478,4.0,Rabota,11,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100748577036979299291/reviews?hl=en-GB

The 3 courses costed 78 euro, plus drinks (in our case it was just water and that costed 8 euro per person). The first step was additional to the menu, it was 3 different pieces, a clam, a zucchini “cake” and a fork with meat. To me that one-bite of pastrami was the actual best part of the meal, is was just sorry there was not more of it. As a second step we had the appetiser, quite nice but a strong olive oil taste on the sauce. Third was the filet mignon, it was very nice, probably prepared with a technique I am not familiar with because it was the palest presentation I’ve seen of this cut of meat. Finally the desert, to me the sorbet was a bit out of place, it was very acid and was not really complementing the rest of the dish. The cream with the crunchy bits was amazing.

Service: Very friendly, but incompetent for a Michelin starred restaurant. Our waiter goofed on explaining the pricing of supplementary items on the menu. There were also repeated goofs with serving: The truffle, being shaved too enthusiastically, flew everywhere, including on my clothes. He missed the center of my plate when spooning in the sauce for the pithiviers, and missed the plate entirely when doing the same thing for a nearby table. The table wasn’t wiped until requested. Water was left empty. And finally, coffee was offered at the end of the meal but no fee was mentioned - I was surprised when I saw it on the bill for 8 EUR a cup. The waiter should have been more clear that there would be a charge because the way it was offered made it sound like it was being provided gratis.
