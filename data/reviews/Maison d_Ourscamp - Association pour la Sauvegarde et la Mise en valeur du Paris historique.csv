ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuczRPMnBBRRAB,"Maison d'Ourscamp, in the Marais, very close to Saint Paul. The first house on this site was built in the second half of the 13th century on land received as a donation, in 1248, by the Cistercian monks of the Abbey of Notre-Dame d'Ourscamp, located near Noyon (Oise). This was their ""town house."" The monks used it to store the crops and various products of the abbey to later resell them in the Parisian markets. Built entirely of stone, it had a cellar of about 200 m², a room with pillars on the ground floor and an upper floor. Today, the Gothic cellar, part of the ground floor pavement and the vestiges of a large fireplace are preserved from this house. Over time, part of the initial surfaces would be rented to different people. In fact, the monks preferred to make a profit from the rents than anything else, so they rented them to merchants and artisans in the area. In 1585 it was rebuilt, to be transformed into three different houses (on the sites of the current numbers 44, 46 and 48 rue François-Miron). Numbers 44 and 46 survived, and are the ones visited today as ""Maison d'Ourscamp"". They consist of a main body with a stone façade, pierced by large mullioned windows and smaller openings. At the back there are two wooden stairs that surround a small half-timbered courtyard. There were two cantilevered toilets in them. The house has three floors and a two-level attic under a typical roof of the time. The two dormers that open the first level of the attic have pediments sculpted in the style of the 16th century. With the Revolution, the religious orders were dissolved. Ourscamp Abbey was expropriated and the house was transferred to Parisian merchants who would succeed each other over time until the 20th century, modifying the building. Little by little, the Marais, a neighborhood that had known the splendor of the private mansions of the 17th century, fell into oblivion and deteriorated considerably. During the first half of the 20th century, the degradation of the building continued. The city council identified 17 ""unhealthy"" blocks. With this term they referred to buildings that had to be eliminated because the living conditions inside were intolerable from all points of view: threat of ruin, lack of light, poor sanitation, etc. The Ourscamp house was in unhealthy block number 16. In 1961, the city council decided to demolish it. Many people opposed this drastic measure (demolishing the house). It was then (1963) when the association for the Safeguarding and Enhancement of Historical Paris, abbreviated ""Paris Historique"", appeared, which clearly positioned itself against this aberrant measure and, after long discussions, made the city reconsider its decision. . Paris accepted the restoration of the old houses, with the exception of numbers 44 and 46, considered to be in very poor condition. For these two, the restoration would be carried out entirely by the association. This association is currently in the house, already restored, except for the 13th century Gothic cellar, which is currently being fully restored, although the works have been stopped for more than a year. This basement is historical heritage.",3 months ago,2025-01-24 12:28:12.265053,5.0,jmtt vbgp,744,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104511820868043898884/reviews?hl=en
