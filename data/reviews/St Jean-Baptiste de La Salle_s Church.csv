ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsbmR5UkNREAE,"Today a so-called “charity” parish sale was held. But charity is only in name. This free-for-all seems mainly aimed at professionals and not at people from the parish and the neighborhood. Attention  ! You must receive a ticket to have access to the stands, but the ticket is only given at the beginning, so if you come after the opening, because you are working, and because you are not a professional, do not count not have access to the stands! Especially if you're from the neighborhood. In addition, second-hand dealers pass tickets on to each other, preventing access to individuals.  And this with complete impunity, without volunteers intervening, through complacency, duplicity and complicity. In fact the entire system put in place - very opaque - seems intended to give priority access to second-hand dealers - and we perceive certain connivance of the people who make up this little world on both sides, to the detriment of others, including the faithful. of the parish that we hear complaining about the situation, undoubtedly because these professionals pay for their purchases in cash... With complete discretion. Business is business.  The very hidden nature of this money deserves serious control by the public authorities (there is no trace of the transaction as soon as you pay in cash...). Only profit counts - but for whose benefit? Where is this money going? To whom? If at least it served to compensate the victims of attacks perpetrated by priests and recognized by Catholic authorities. Transparency and truth are essential. Furthermore, the people who oversee this sale are mostly odious and contemptuous, the absolute opposite of a Christian attitude.  They follow others in their tracks just to deceive, out of hypocrisy, to give themselves legitimacy because they know them to be honest, therefore without risk... On the other hand and conversely, they let others steal in front of them. them, shamelessly, in flagrante delicto but letting them do it! For fear of reprisals? By tacit complicity? In any case, this experience was an absolute disappointment but obviously the atmosphere perceived here corresponds to the other comments posted online.  Everything this morning was just bad spirits and a bad atmosphere. A complete lack of education. A real hell. Finally, if you don't come when it opens on the first day, there's no point in coming later, there will be nothing left. The second-hand dealers snatched up everything for their business and that of the parish. Going there after the first morning is therefore just a waste of time. Frankly, there are much better places in the neighborhood.",a year ago,2024-12-27 20:33:48.850173,1.0,Sylvain Desmille,611,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105138655227850054254/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1bmEybG13RRAB,"HOLINESS FOR SALE $€$€$€$€$ I would like to share here that this institution, which deceptively passes for a church, is nothing more than a grasping and greedy exclusive social club for upper-middle-class Catholics of the 15th century. I sent a very sick and destitute homeless woman to this church to request a mass. She requested a free or low-cost mass as she prayed to God regarding her illness and homelessness. And the people of this church refused it!!! These cruel people refused it because they are nothing more than a country club that is only interested in accumulating money and power to protect themselves and themselves. to advance their exclusive social lives and to ensure the conservative, exclusive and privileged education of their privileged children. One of the virtues of Catholicism is said to be non-attachment to material wealth. Jesus was poor, and all of his TRUE disciples were always poor and not power-crazed or money-hungry. It is disgusting that the secretary of this church refused to allow a service to a poor, sick, homeless woman because she had no money. Saying a Holy Mass is a sacramental ritual. This means that holiness is now FOR SALE. And the poor and homeless who are most desperate are not rich enough to afford the holiness of our miserable and debased days. If a church won't help a homeless person, then why should that church exist? It is certainly not a holy place. Just a shame.
