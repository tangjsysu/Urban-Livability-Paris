ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyXzVDZmV3EAE,"Brilliant, inspiring apartment. It was a beautiful day to visit and every room was breathtaking. I enjoyed the layout and the views on the rooftop. The balcony wasn't accessible, however there was no need as the views out from the dining, living and kitchen spaces was more than enough. A brilliant visit, that I hope to take my kids to explore and see one day.",2 years ago,2025-03-15 22:49:44.347299,5.0,Anne-Marie Falano,38,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117967548355706549748/reviews?hl=en-US
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkcFpQMWRnEAE,"The apartment in itself is beautiful and inspiring for anyone who is a Corbusier fan. However, my overall experience around the visit was a bit disappointing. When given a half an hour timeframe (which is quite tight already), one would hope to actually be able to utilize the full 30 minutes to explore the apartment without rushing through.  Firstly the staff managing the visit didn’t arrive or let us into the building until a couple of minutes after the set starting time at 13:30. Secondly, while I don’t mind walking up 7 flights of stairs at all, it did take some time - which I don’t think should be time included in the 30 minute timeframe itself considering time is already precious. Once upstairs it took another couple of minutes until they let us into the actual apartment, leaving around only 20 or so minutes for the actual visit. And with 5 minutes left, they told us the visit was over and that we had to leave as they had another group (the guided tour) starting at 14:00.  Overall - it’s worth a visit and I really enjoyed it, but it did feel rushed and was definitely shorter than the advertised 30 minutes. Hoping it was a one off rather than the standard.",a year ago,2025-03-15 22:49:44.348445,4.0,Isabelle Lindblom,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100873538220718071447/reviews?hl=en-US
