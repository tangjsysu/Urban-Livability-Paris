ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNndHE2VDJ3RRAB,"A FIVE STAR visit to the historic Petit Palais art museum in Paris! Just blocks from the Eiffel Tower and across the street from the Grand Palais, this stunning landmark blends tradition with modernity. Designed by Charles Girault for the 1900 World’s Fair, the building surrounds a beautiful inner garden, creating an elegant, open courtyard feel. Renovated in 2005, the Petit Palais houses a remarkable permanent collection of paintings, sculptures, furniture, and decorative arts, along with special exhibitions. Visitors can admire masterpieces by Rembrandt, Rubens, Fragonard, Courbet, Monet, Cézanne, and Modigliani. Beyond the museum’s extraordinary artwork, a striking statue of Winston Churchill appears to be strolling the grounds on the southeast corner. My favorite exhibit during the visit was The Tower of Books by Seth, featuring a child perched on top. Seth explains, “I love books. They’re a way to experience other lives, other universes. As a child, I read a lot. Books took me on adventures, allowed me to escape the mundane…” (See photos)",3 weeks ago,2025-03-15 23:22:27.631390,5.0,Robert B Butler,156,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107164760911393890000/reviews?hl=en
