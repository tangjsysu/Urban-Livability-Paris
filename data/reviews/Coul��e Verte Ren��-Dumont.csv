It was a really lovely walk, in some places it felt a little more run down than most but it's generally a really well maintained route with both art and nature. A nice escape from bustling streets.

We appreciated the nice street views.  Consider this place to take cool pictures of the green alley and beautiful buildings around.  We recommend it because it’s a really cool and green space in the middle of Paris.  Many locals go for a walk or get their daily dose of jogging.  To rest, you can sit on one of the benches and fill up your water at the water fountain.  We noticed shopping stores just down the entrance, but we didn’t stop to take a look.
