ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJc2ZTN2xBRRAB,"From 1668 to 1705, Louis XIII's enclosure was razed and the ramparts were moved further north, in the form of a wide earthen boulevard lined with elms, the Nouveau-Cours (now Grands Boulevards). The Porte Richelieu was razed in 1701 and, on October 18, 1704, a decree from the King's Council of State ordered the extension of Rue Richelieu between the current Rue Feydeau and the Grands Boulevards5. France's first fortune, Antoine Crozat took over relay of Richelieu and Mazarin, great money merchants, who had successively occupied the southern part and the central part of the current street. He then built a private mansion at the end of rue de Richelieu, thus extended6, the Hôtel de Choiseul, in addition to another hotel that he acquired on Place Vendôme, the Hôtel de Gramont, now the Ritz. In the 18th century, the former palace of Mazarin housed the Paris Stock Exchange and, from 1721, the collections of the Royal Library, ancestor of the National Library of France. In 1868, Henri Labrouste completely rebuilt the wing of the library overlooking rue Richelieu. In 1779, the Quinze-Vingts hospital, which was located on rue Saint-Honoré, in line with rue de Richelieu, was transferred rue de Charenton. The building was then destroyed and rue de Richelieu was extended to the south by rue de Rohan.",5 years ago,2024-12-27 21:07:47.283347,4.0,JD Titu,96,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115047633307741439872/reviews?hl=en-GB
