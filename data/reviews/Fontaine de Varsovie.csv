ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCXzliNnhBRRAB,"Trocadero Fountain The Warsaw Fountain is located in the Trocadero Gardens, below the Trocadero Palace, in the 6th arrondissement.  The main feature, called the Warsaw Fountain, is a 12-meter-tall basin; and ten arches of water. At one end, facing the Seine, are 20 powerful water cannons, capable of shooting a jet of water 50 meters away. Above the long basin are two smaller ones, linked to the lower basin by cascades flanked by 32-meter-high water sprays. These fountains are the only gallery fountains still standing today, and they still function the same. In 2011, the fountain's waterworks were completely renovated and a modern pumping system was installed.",a year ago,2025-01-24 13:09:29.816277,5.0,Mohammad Ayoub,230,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102613109672441235778/reviews?hl=en-GB
