ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURubWZfRU5nEAE,Another Paris icon worth the hype. My fiancé and I came here after our engagement and the bartenders took great care of us. The other pub goers are friendly. No music in the bar is a great touch - really helps breed conversation with the other patrons. Great American bourbons to select from!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3eFl2SUZREAE,"What a unique place! I'd been here with friends and I totally enjoyed the vibes. It's one of the oldest bars in Europe. The waiters are quite warm and helpful. The only thing you can order to eat here are hotdogs. The drinks are on the expensive side, but worth a try. Also, their famous drink is Bloody Mary(order only if you haven't had tomato soup before, because the taste is literally like that). The other drinks are pretty good. You can also look around in the restaurant to find some old items of importance from the USA.",5 months ago,2025-01-24 13:58:16.081028,4.0,Pruthvi,103,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109528835890839402813/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIOGZmdEJnEAE,"A must-visit for any cocktail lover. Iconic in its own right, but bring a large group to make the most of your evening!  We purposely planned dinner around going out for a drink after at Harry’s Bar and we’re so pleased we did.  Visited on a Saturday evening at 10:30 and there was a short queue to enter but the member of staff who kept checking on us was very communicative about wait times and what to expect.  Inside is a buzzy vibe with no music - strange at first, but the general chatter should be enough to provide the vibe.  As a couple, we felt that bringing a larger group might be more fun! Plus that also gives you the opportunity to try more cocktails.  We ordered the French 75 and a Peat Manhattan, both very well-made and so good BUT it was hard to decide which cocktail to order since they all looked so delicious.
