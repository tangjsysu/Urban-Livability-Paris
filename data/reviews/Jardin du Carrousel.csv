ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6Z2R1cnhBRRAB,"It was redesigned in the 1990s, following a competition won by Belgian landscape firm¬†Jacques Wirtz. The winning design looked good in theory (and from an aerial viewpoint), with its series of radial lines stretching elegantly out from the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, first as stone lines in sand and then as yew hedges in grass. Statues by Aristide Maillol, which had been in the park since the 1960s, were placed playfully among the new hedges. The effect was like the rays of the sun, or stretching fingers, providing widening paths that encouraged visitors to promenade throughout the park. The radial design also echoed I. M. Pei‚Äôs glittering new pyramid in the Louvre courtyard, spreading the same triangular shape out horizontally on the park surface. But on the ground, the park does not work well at all. From most angles it is difficult to perceive the radial design. The grubby stone lines are interrupted by litter bins, food stands and seemingly unrelated horse chestnut trees. ÔøºThe grass is often threadbare and frequently re-turfed, with stone walkways being inserted where it is has simply proved unsustainable. The yew hedges look squat, lumpy and randomly",8 months ago,2025-02-09 14:52:37.383364,5.0,Balaji hadde,33,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105347028667498391136/reviews?hl=en
