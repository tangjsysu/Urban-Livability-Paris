You can get an audio guide for a 2€ but I only found that out once I was walking around inside the exhibition spaces. I feel it would be nicer to see more of the original building on the ground floor. It has free lockers for your bag but very few for big bags, so be mindful of that. Other than that the staff are nice and if you love medieval ages of France and surrounding areas, then it’s definitely worth your time!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqM3QyQmpBRRAB,"This was an amazing museum however I have a few points 1. If you go in with a basic understanding of the middle ages, it's probably not enough to full understand the exhibits so study beforehand 2.

The display of each of the thousands of pieces is well thought out and permits the viewer to truly absorb the work. The piece de resistance is the room of 'The Lady and the Unicorn' pieces, huge tapestries which are amazing examples of their time and age.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNINzRHVW5nRRAB,"A great museum filled with rich history and art almost marred by Fawlty towers-esque staff. One floor was inexplicably closed and when exploring the  other floor, again, inexplicably was told it would be closing as well. All museum guests ushered to the Cafe and courtyard- perhaps in an attempt to force them to purchase sodastream water and coffee from a machine I have only seen in 7/11. Once the next floor opened; there was a mad rush, and once waiting for this to subside we were then told it was closed again! Well all exits were blocked and staff then walked off to speak on walkie talkies whilst ignoring our pleas for access to the museum we had paid to enter. We were finally and graciously allowed access! By this point anything the staff did was obvious and thus annoying- slamming staff only access doors, lingering in narrow doorways or crossing in front of you on their patrols. Sad that my experience will have this annoyance attached. I would still recommend the museum as the information attached to each item is great, and the museum is well laid out.",6 months ago,2025-03-15 22:25:02.688691,5.0,charlotte!,31,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101756489259705126533/reviews?hl=en
