Funny thing is that unlike all places in the US where restrooms are free to use, this place charges 1 Euro and inspite of paying that the faucets were broken, no soap in bathroom and it was a mess inside. This is typical of most places in Paris or Brussels where you got to pay to use a restroom and it isn't even worth the money. Europe sure is a poor place looking to suck money out of you. The more you hang out in the big cities in France and Belgium, the more you appreciate the generosity of the US that doesn't nickel and dime you on using a bathroom.
