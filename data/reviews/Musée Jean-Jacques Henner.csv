ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNUotN2lnRRAB,"I visited only because my best friend is named Henner and has a poster from the museum on his wall. The building itself is very interesting and worth seeing, though I'm not sure the collection and its descriptions do enough to justify a whole museum dedicated to this one artist. Still, you can see the whole exhibit in under an hour and learn about Henner and his contemporaries in less time than you'd stand in line at the Louvre.",a year ago,2025-03-15 23:08:27.012263,4.0,Bill Bois,269,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100351175978118123231/reviews?hl=en-US
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBZ2FpYkFREAE,"Perfect example of paternalism: the female pupils of Henner were his clones. And their conservative art was totally out of touch with the modern world. At the same time, Impressionism was in full bloom, with talented, creative and free female painters: Berthe Morisot, Mary Cassatt, Marie Bracquemond, Eva Gonzales, Cecilia Beaux…. You can skip Musee Henner and his mediocre little repetitive talent, except if you are obsessed with red-hair nude models.",a month ago,2025-03-15 23:08:27.013366,2.0,Bème,107,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103922422297528093984/reviews?hl=en-US

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3OXZEeTlnRRAB,Quiet and not too crowded museum. The venue is more interesting than the paintings themselves. But it is my personal opinion. This workshop-type house has French ceiling and old wooden staircases which create a home-like atmosphere.
