This museum is made up of several thematic spaces (their classification, the large stones, the colors, the shapes, the stones of meteorites, etc.) which present the most beautiful stones and their diversity.  The presentation is of high quality with written explanations and videos.  The classification of stones is presented.  The geology and evolution of the earth is not presented.  The museum is playful and we saw the smile of the children in front of the spectacle of these stones.  It usually takes 1 hour to visit this museum.  We took 2 hours.  Excellent. Weak point.

The explanatory panels that are there are very text heavy - even the digital ones and could not get my kids excited. In general the museum does not make any effort to cater to kids. There is nothing to touch, nothing to help them see the rocks higher up, no panels to explain phenomena in kids friendly terms or that put things in relation to what kids know or understand.
