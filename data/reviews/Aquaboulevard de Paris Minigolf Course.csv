Because even if it is surely for hygiene reasons, a woman is wearing a swimsuit top so we can clearly see that these are not her everyday shorts! Especially if this need for shorts is necessary to hide and protect scars like me....  I also find it bad that there is no picnic feel inside the water park because we were forced to eat it at 10am!
