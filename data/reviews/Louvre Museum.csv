ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQeXB5Q3pnRRAB,Highly recommend to book timed entry tickets in advance. Also have a plan in place and a list of must sees if you want to cover the museum in an organized way. We only had a couple of hours but we were able to make the most of it because we had a good plan. The museum is spectacular and magnanimous. Over 35000 exhibit display across 3 wings. We really enjoyed it a lot. It’s a must see in Paris.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzOXRmRWV3EAE,Excellent museum with state-of-the-art facilities and impressive architecture. It includes many departments and collections. I was impressed by the ancient Greek and Hellenistic period exhibits as well as Delacroix's paintings. At least 2 to 3 hours are required for a tour. Unfortunately the maps didn't help much and the heat was unbearable. I would like to admire those ancient Greek masterpieces in their place of origin and not in European museums.

This is one of the most popular museums in the world. There will be lines, there will be tons of people. I went on a cold and rainy day and it was still busy.  2. The museum layout is a little confusing. The maps you can take with you eliminate a lot of rooms, so get a feel for how the room numbers work so you can always figure out which way to go.  3.

Surrounded by crowds, it still managed to stand out as a symbol of artistic brilliance.

Another highlight of my visit was the stunning collection of royal ornaments. The intricate craftsmanship of the crowns, scepters, and jewels was dazzling.
