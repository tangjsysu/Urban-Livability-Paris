ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlamNhZm1RRRAB,"Disrespectful manager insulting children and parents!!! Verbal and physical aggression on his part because my 1 year old daughter vomited during her second ride. He bluntly blamed my daughter for having vomited and asked us to leave because the man wanted to restart the ride and not even offer anything to clean my daughter up. The well-being of children is not at all one of its values ‚Äã‚Äãand it's a shame when you work with children on a daily basis!!! I was insulted by all the names before he came and grabbed my arm, holding out his fist at me in front of my daughter and the passers-by, on the verge of hitting me!!! Fortunately, the police intervened.
