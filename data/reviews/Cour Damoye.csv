ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2cS03NkN3EAE,"A hidden alley with undeniable charm It is through a simple door wedged between two uninspiring cafes that one reaches this small lane connecting the Place de la Bastille to the rue Daval.  Impossible to imagine what we will find behind!  But once the grid is passed, it's very simple, you enter another world.  The hubbub of Place de la Bastille and the hustle and bustle of rue de Lappe are over.  Here it looks like time has stood still.  This cobbled alley, around a hundred meters long, is bordered by small buildings with typically industrial facades and nicely dressed with climbing plants.  When it was laid out by Antoine Pierre Damoye, an 18th century hardware store, the courtyard, like many other passages and courtyards in eastern Paris, housed dozens of artisan workshops from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.  Completely renovated in the 1990s, this small enclave has not lost all of its yesteryear atmosphere.  Today, it certainly houses a few communications agency offices, but also a workshop for restoring old posters, a leather goods maker and a roasting workshop, installed in place of the former Daval Brûlerie, one of the most emblematic brands of the capital for nearly fifty years.
