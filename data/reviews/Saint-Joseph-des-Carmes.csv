ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwcjVTN0hREAE,It is a great and beautiful place I gave it four stars because you have to enter through the University so you have to go through a horde of smoking college students. Then you have to go and check in with the reception and give them your ID or passport so they can make a record of your visit. It‚Äôs very confusing and poorly designed entrance to just visit the chapel for Frederic Ozanam or to visit the church. Also to even visit the tomb for Ozanam it‚Äôs only open on Saturdays at 3 PM but there‚Äôs no signage and no information on the website not very user or visitor friendly.,5 years ago,2024-12-27 20:14:32.109483,4.0,Scott Jakubowski,820,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113422304467528660584/reviews?hl=en-GB
