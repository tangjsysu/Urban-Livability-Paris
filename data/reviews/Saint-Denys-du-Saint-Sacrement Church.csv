ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrNTUtSkFREAE,We visited this beautiful Catholic Church April 2019 for Easter Mass. As a Altar Boy from the 60's I found this to be a great example of what you'd expect to see in a Catholic Church from this period.  Very friendly congregation. An elderly lady greeted everyone at the end of each pew with the famous French Cheek Kiss. What a surprise to my wife and I who had traveled here from Texas.  Beautiful music with pipe organ from the balcony above and behind us. If you want a great experience visit this Church during a service even if you are not Catholic. The Church exudes history. It's a must see while in Paris.,7 months ago,2024-12-27 20:19:23.791162,5.0,Richard,219,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115612961127035131774/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjOTlMMHl3RRAB,We walked past this place a few times since it was close to our Airbnb. AT first glance I thought it was a temple because of the large pillars out front. It wasn't until after looking at the carving and the cross that I figured out it was a church. There were also statues in the walls of the building. I didn't have time to go in but did look it was open in the mornings.,4 years ago,2024-12-27 20:19:23.791162,4.0,Benedict Uy,"3,512",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117720045831313801659/reviews?hl=en-GB

The nave is decorated with a superb fresco and a magnificent pediment painted to the glory of Jesus Christ. A fairly rare floor since this one is made of beveled parquet slats.. I have never seen this elsewhere.. There are also great paintings, one of which is Eugène Delacroix yes, Delacroix! It symbolizes the descent of Christ from the cross, Mary, his mother who welcomes him in her arms, is completely defeated. Mary Magdalene also appears on this representation of a scene from the life of Christ. Below this one , there is a sculpture of St. Mary, it is also very beautiful.. This church, at first glance simple, looking more like a temple than a church, reveals all its beauty to us as soon as we pass through the large doors. It is magnificent, serene, bright and full of charm! A station of the cross goes around, the scenes are made of enameled terracotta, they are all sober and simple.
