ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2OXJfMXpRRRAB,We visited yesterday on our tour of Paris. The church was free to enter. What a beautiful church built between 1532 and 1633. It is simply beautiful inside the church. Amazing art work and decoration. Beautiful altar. The architecture outside is also very beautiful. There are various chapels around the church that are breathtaking. This is a must visit when in Paris. We loved our visit and highly recommend spending time here visiting.,a week ago,2024-12-27 20:10:11.596371,5.0,Michael Mack,"1,082",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114005357228763716309/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURud2FuZHZRRRAB,This is just a really old but beautiful church. It's quite rundown and I can see at the moment that they are trying to do renovations. I went there recently and there was a concert on which was really lovely to walk around and listen to. It is always very busy here no matter when you go. I always try my best though to be respectful of those who are in prayerüôè,2 months ago,2024-12-27 20:10:11.596371,5.0,Brid,417,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118364008054074247056/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzX19tZ1BBEAE,This is one of Paris's great churches.  Beautiful Gothic interior; interesting side chapels (one with a Keith Haring triptych); and an amazing organ.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYM2MzR09nEAE,"It is a huge church, with ceilings so high that one can only admire the architectural prowess. Paris may be the city with the greatest number of beautiful churches in the world. But make no mistake, it is impossible to point to one church or cathedral and declare that this one is the most beautiful. Which one would it be? St. Peter in the Vatican? St. Paul in London? Seville Cathedral? El Duomo in Milan? La Mesquita in Cordoba? There are too many magnificent cathedrals. But in Paris, there are so many incredibly beautiful churches that wherever you throw a stone, you will find one (and you can't see them all). And Saint-Eustache is just one of them.  Btw, unlike in other countries (like Spain), there is no entrance fee in Paris churches.",2 months ago,2024-12-27 20:10:11.597372,5.0,Dan Maarek,692,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101092586438291424548/reviews?hl=en-GB
