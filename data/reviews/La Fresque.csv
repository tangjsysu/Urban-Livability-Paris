ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmeHJpb1ZBEAE,"Absolutely amazing food here. We found this place randomly near our hotel when we were visiting. It was incredibly unassuming given its location near the mall and train station. However, the food was incredible. We decided to go the set menu route, and were so glad we did. The duck was out of this world, and the dessert was so delicious.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROMVp1OHJBRRAB,Great relation quality-price. I went there for lunch and profited from the lunch offer: 19 euros for 2 courses which is the cheapest price u can find in Paris. The entree was enjoyable with snails and 2 type of seafood. The other entree was an average chicken nugget style but still well cooked. The main course was a real surprise: a big portion full of meat veggies and flavor.,11 months ago,2025-01-24 13:54:25.228994,4.0,ajla dunga,105,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104938735685665545081/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqcVpyWTNnRRAB,"La Fresque is a must! You must experience the quaint atmosphere. You must experience the amazing service. You must enjoy the imaginative and delicious dishes! We had creme de Foie Gras and ceviche de Bar aux agrumes to start. The ceviche was very special, not chopped up fish ends, instead a complete, gorgeous fillet, fantastically seasoned, not too acidic. Truly a joy! The Magret de Canard sauce miel aux épices with duo de purée (pommes-de-terre et carottes) was absolutely delicious. The hatching of the skin rendered the fat and made the skin crispy while maintaining the tenderness of the breast. And the sauce was a thing of mastery, so light and slightly sweet with wonderful spices. Highly recommend this wonderful little establishment!
