I encountered very professional and friendly staff, but some employees were too busy chatting during work hours, completely ignoring customers. Since I am not fluent in French, I strongly felt the impatience of the cashier, which was very disappointing.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNycmJQRHZnRRAB,"Contemporary art will always be an acquired taste for me. The current exhibition featuring an American athlete turned sculptor has a great narrative especially in explaining the tension points between developing muscles and letting someone’s creativity manifest.  However… while the clay exhibits were impressive, some areas I found underwhelming. For example, the ground floor had smeared mud on them which I get were symbolic but I couldn’t find more depth beyond my visual interpretation. Again, subjective. The sensorial recorded performance was haunting but also a slow burn.

It is located in a glass and steel building designed by Jean Nouvel, which blends with the surrounding garden created by Lothar Baumgarten. It hosts temporary exhibitions of various artists from different disciplines and backgrounds.  👍 I recommend this place, which is very creative and original. The exhibitions are usually pretty great and show different perspectives and expressions of contemporary art. The entrance fee is good, but even better if you pay the annual subscription (it's kind of the same price as two tickets). You can also enjoy the garden, which is a peaceful oasis in the city.  🌟 I give 5 stars to this place, which is a nice and inspiring place to visit.

You could also access a small bookshop on the first floor having a good collection of art and photography related books among others. The best part for me is that they provide free entry for students after 6pm on Tuesdays!
