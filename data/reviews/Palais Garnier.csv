ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzdjdXc2lBRRAB,"Very beautiful building! We didn’t get online tickets as we heard that the opera’s access is not always open for visitors. We bought our tickets from the ticket desk at the reception and everything was very quick. No queue no waiting. Once inside, the architecture is breathtaking! Looks like a mini (very mini) version of Versailles. Definitely, one of the most beautiful buildings in Paris, both from inside and outside!",a month ago,2024-12-28 15:04:42.492764,5.0,Borislav Tomov,59,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100216758356131986422/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2Njg3aTdBRRAB,"Wowwee! We went just to see the building. The opera showing (or not actually, because they were on strike!), was a modern one and not to our taste, but the building itself is absolutely fabulous! And we're lucky enough to be able to go into the auditorium, because the rehearsal which ought to have been taking place was canceled. But that's only the part of it!  We were booked on a guided tour. With William. I have to tell you that the guided tour was absolutely brilliant. The building is one thing, but the performance YES PERFORMANCE of our tour guide William was worth the money in itself. It was a masterpiece of off-stage theatre and made the whole experience exceptional. He had us entertained from the first minute to the last. Brilliant. I'm not sure whether you can request your tour guide, but if you can, then make a bid for William's tour. Ours was in English, but he speaks several other languages. Being so funny in a language other than your first takes real skill.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQaWZhcV93RRAB,I had never heard of this landmark before I had reached Paris. But it was really unjustified as this is one of the best places to see in the world. It is really 'Gawdy'. But I don't know too many places to view such a place. Decor to every corner is very detailed and extravagant. definitely worth a visit. Takes an hour or 2 to see. Price was not too bad. Not sure if they still do plays here but I would like to see one here. The line was very short.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYbF9pNkZ3EAE,"It was my first time in such a magnificent place. I arrived on Saturday after lunch, so it wasn’t very crowded. However, within an hour, people began pouring in, and the atmosphere turned quite chaotic. I found myself imagining wearing a different outfit, in another century, on a different occasion, strolling through the corridors, the auditorium, or even the stage, fully immersed in the golden age. This experience felt even more special because I was brought here by people who cherished me deeply.

There is an elevator, there are beautiful wide stairs. There is a souvenir shop at the exit from the theater. to get inside. I didn't wait very long on the street.
