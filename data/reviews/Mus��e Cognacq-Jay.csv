ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROdnJLMGN3EAE,"Our spontaneous decision to visit Musée Cognacq-Jay turned out to be a highlight of our Parisian adventure. Tucked away in a picturesque part of Paris, this museum is a treasure trove of art and history.  The museum itself is a revelation, especially considering its modest size. We were captivated by the diverse collection of paintings, sculptures, and artefacts, each with its own story and charm. The variety and quality of the exhibits were unexpected, offering a rich visual feast.  We spent a delightful hour wandering through the museum, admiring every painting and item. The intimate setting allowed us to appreciate the details of each piece, making the experience both personal and profound.  What’s remarkable about Musée Cognacq-Jay is that it offers this wonderful experience free of charge. It’s a rare find in a city filled with expensive attractions.  We wholeheartedly recommend a visit to Musée Cognacq-Jay for anyone looking for a beautiful and serene cultural experience in Paris.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMmRhYWNBEAE,"When visiting the Marais and Paris in general, I think it’s always a wonderful idea to visit the smaller museums to get a more intimate side of the city. And sometimes, they’re even free admission.  This museum is free to enter. Once a 17th century home of a local aristocrat, now is an art museum with paintings, sculptures and furniture.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlejhqT1F3EAE,"The Cognacq-Jay Museum, in the heart of the Marais, recreates the atmosphere of a Parisian residence in the Age of Enlightenment.  Located in a beautiful 16th-century mansion, between courtyard and garden, the museum houses an exceptional set of 18th-century works of art: paintings by Boucher, Chardin and Fragonard, drawings by Watteau, sculptures, stamped furniture and precious objects (jewellery, tobacconists, Saxony porcelain...).  Ernest Cognacq and his wife Louise Jay, founders of the La Samaritaine department store, bequeathed the collections to the City of Paris in 1928.

Although the museum is small, 3 floors with mainly 9 rooms, it bloats a nice selection of pieces of art : Asian deco, European and mainly french classic paintings, European deco, other exciting paintings from famous artists such Vigee Le Brun , Bouchee and Rembrandt. Everything was reviously owned by Cognacq-Jay: a couple of Art Lovers and patreons - Paris inherited their Hotel privé (a mansion from the 17th century in le Marais) and everything in it. Now, the mansion lives as a public free museum. I highly reccomend you give it a chance if you are nearby.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNveHFUMFpREAE,"The Musee Cognacq-Jay is one of fourteen City of Paris Museums, housed in former Hotel Doren building in The Marais. It is located near to Musee Carnavalet and makes a nice complement to its larger peer. This museum is free to visit and well worth your time if you are interested in seeing 18th century furnishing, paintings and other artworks. There are some later works included in this collection as well.  The Musee Cognacq-Jay is the result of a wonderful collection gathered by Ernest Cognacg and his wife Marie-Louise Jay between 1900 and 1925. Upon the death of Cognacq in 1928, the collection was bestowed to the city of Paris where it became a museum, originally located on Blvd. des Capucines. The museum collection was moved to the present site, the historic Hotel Doren, in 1990 and this is where it can be found today.  When visiting the Musee Cognacq-Jay, you can explore twenty panelled rooms, each well decorated with historic paintings, porcelain, elegant furniture and other works of art. Works by numerous French and foreigner artists can be found including the likes of La Tour, Lemoyne, Chardin, Fragonard, Boucher, Degas as well as Rembrandt and Cannaletto amongst others.  Overall, we'd suggest first prioritising a visit to nearby Musee Carnavalet and then paying visit to Musee Cognacq-Jay if time (and energy) permits. It is a nice museum to visit if you intend to spend time in The Marais and can comfortably be explored in 45 minutes before moving onward.",5 years ago,2024-12-27 21:52:06.438103,4.0,Brad,"5,430",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en

He's an extraordinary painter from between the French revolutions, full of humour and way ahead of his time in many ways (he put himself in his paintings and broke the 3rd wall, and used optical techniques to great effect).  Suggestion: use google translate to convert info boards to English images. There were no translations for this exhibition.  There were some quite interesting items in the permanent exhibition, but I don't know what the Museum has when there is no special exhibition. It's normally free though, so nothing to lose on visiting.
