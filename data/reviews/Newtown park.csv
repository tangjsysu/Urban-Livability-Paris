I was surprised to see that the latter didn't offer anything for snacks even though I'm used to going to other brands such as Royal Kids which offer a lot of choice. I notice that 90% of the customers sitting at the tables next to me have brought cakes, drinks and chips with them. I then decided to go to another store in the city to buy a snack for my daughters despite the fact that the person at reception showed me that food would be prohibited... on my return I was taken aback. side by the security guard. I then explain to him that the majority of customers eat cakes from outside so I don't see why it would be prohibited for me and not for others. The supervisor arrives with an aggressive statement ""for you it's no, the others I haven't seen them I don't care"". So I explain that my daughter being diabetic she needs to eat and that therefore she will just go to the entrance to have her cake then return and that her answer I got: it's almost 6 p.m. that's not the time. snack time and if they cross the barrier they won't come back. I am literally shocked by this lack of heart in the situation. At no time did they apologize for not offering anything or offer me a solution.

He offered me a place in exchange, but my son categorically refused to return. I then asked him to give me tokens to take my daughter bowling.  The next day, I run errands and drop my kids off at the park before joining them later. To my great surprise, this same employee dared to reproach me for having let my children in without paying for tickets, when they had simply come in to use the tokens from the day before, he told me that just to enter and look I had to pay.
