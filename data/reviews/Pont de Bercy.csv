ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3a3VxQzhBRRAB,"The Bercy bridge crosses the Seine near the neighborhood of the same name, located on the Rive Droite, in the 12th arrondissement. On the other bank, it reaches Boulevard Vincent-Auriol, in the 13th arrondissement of the Rive Gauche. Apart from two separate lanes for cars, sidewalks and bicycle lanes, metro line 6 also passes through it, elevated on another small bridge. The initial bridge was inaugurated in 1864. Before, the crossing between the two banks was made by ferry, through this same place. The bridge was included in the Haussmanian reforms promoted by Napoleon III. In 1904 it was widened for the first time, so that the metro viaduct could be built above it. In 1992 it was widened again, to its current width. This time it was done with the idea of â€‹â€‹returning the initial symmetry, since, in the 1904 expansion, the metro occupied the north side, and the cars passed on the south side. Now, the subway runs through the center of the bridge. For this second expansion, reinforced concrete was used, although it was covered with stone, leaving it practically identical to the original.",5 months ago,2025-01-24 13:20:28.712322,5.0,jmtt vbgp,744,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104511820868043898884/reviews?hl=en
