ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQa2E2WXNBRRAB,If you are interested in plants you will enjoy it. There are multiple greenhouses and each greenhouse is geographically related to different regions (like South America) or plant species (orchids).,a month ago,2025-01-24 14:02:05.538553,5.0,Huseyin Senyurt,211,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102394632449186741755/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4LWNfMGZnEAE,"The google directed entrance was blocked by an event and it will be closed until June 16. But the google directive should be fixed.  According to the instructions, after exiting metro 10 at Porte d'Auteuil, you need to take the bus to go 2 more stops and then walk.  But that is not necessary!  (I followed directions and then I found out it was stupid). After exiting metro 10 (exit: Bd de Murat) and on the ground until, look to your right - cross the street and that's the other entrance to the park, very close and convenient.  I arrived after 5pm and the greenhouses were all closed (this doesn't update the system).  You should arrive before 4pm to be able to visit the greenhouse (because it is obviously the special thing about this garden).  Other than that I found the park not very special compared to other parks in Paris.  It is like a garden next to the house, not necessarily beautiful and special to the point of becoming a famous tourist destination.  And it's on the edge of Paris, so it takes a while to get around.  If you are nearby, you can stop by and go for a walk or sunbathe.",a year ago,2025-01-24 14:02:05.540553,3.0,Rachel Ngn,262,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105015594814354595492/reviews?hl=en-GB
