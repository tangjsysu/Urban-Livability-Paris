We find ourselves in a mythical place steeped in history. We are captivated by the trees there and the colorful nest boxes perched on some of them in this place full of serenity and well-being. We discover in particular a gigantic tree, a Paulonia Tomentosa, more than 150 years old, imposing with its presence 3.36m in circumference to tell you that we cannot pass by without seeing it, especially since it is marked by the weight of the years with its shapes. which command admiration, it is so magnificent.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBdHQtT3BBRRAB,"Even if this garden is located in a Hospital, you should not hesitate to visit it  History : Following serious plague epidemics which ravaged Paris in 1605 and 1606, Henry IV decided to build a hospital outside Paris to accommodate contagious patients and at the same time keep them away from the capital. This will be named ‚ÄúSaint-Louis‚Äù in honor of the king who was then thought to have died of the plague (he would in fact have died of dysentery).  The first stone was laid in July 1607. To avoid any contact with the outside population, the hospital and its square courtyard were surrounded by gardens and walls. It is this old central courtyard which is today a pleasant public garden which can be enjoyed freely.  The ground floors were used as cellars and stores while the sick were housed on the upper floors. Behind this central square, the square buildings that you can see as you walk around the outside of the garden served as staff accommodation. Galleries connected these brackets to the central building to avoid ‚Äì once again ‚Äì any contact with the outside.  Finally, observe the architecture and style of the four large buildings that surround the garden. The slate roofs and the facades where red brick and cut stone mix are reminiscent of another major work of Henry IV: the Place des Vosges. Indeed, the architect of the Saint-Louis hospital, Claude Vellefaux, had also worked on the design of the Place Royale!  The Saint-Louis chapel, opened to the public on August 25, 1609, was intended for the population of the suburbs around the hospital.  Today it is a family garden where residents of the neighborhood meet. Still unknown to the general public, it offers a pleasant stopover in history and greenery in the heart of the 10th arrondissement.",7 years ago,2025-02-09 15:13:34.668495,4.0,Jean-Philippe Hebrard,762,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101977848791358220002/reviews?hl=en
