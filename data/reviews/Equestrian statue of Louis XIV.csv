ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKdjQ3YUdnEAE,"The Equestrian Statue of King Louis XIV is a sculpture designed and partially executed by the Italian artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who was originally brought to France to design a new facade of the Louvre, a portrait bust, and an equestrian statue. Bernini first discussed the project while in France in the mid-1660s, but it did not start until later in the decade, when back in Rome. It was not completed until 1684 and then shipped to Paris in 1685. Louis XIV of France was extremely unhappy with the end result and had it placed in a corner of the gardens of the royal palace at Versailles. Soon after, the sculpture was modified by Fran√ßois Girardon and altered into an equestrian sculpture of the ancient Roman hero Marcus Curtius.",a year ago,2025-01-24 13:22:31.626405,5.0,Mircea Dascalescu,194,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102043460252950595949/reviews?hl=en

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodFBQYVhBEAE,"Vigorous and notorious-King Louis XIV is France's one of the most prominent king. Born in 1638, Louis XIV succeeded his father, Louis XIII, as king at the age of five.  He ruled for 72 years, until his death in 1715, making his reign the longest of any European monarch.  By the time he died, he outlived his son and his grandson, leaving the throne to his young great-grandson Louis XV. Louis XIV‚Äôs reign was important in French history not just because it lasted so long but because he was a strong-willed ruler who was determined to make his subjects obey him and to make his kingdom the predominant power in Europe. Versaille immortalized Louis XIV and his personality-noble,glamurous and victorious and the equestrian statue of the Sun-king is an ample evidence of it",a year ago,2025-01-24 13:22:35.833344,5.0,Nick Georgia,192,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106190880404431064150/reviews?hl=en
