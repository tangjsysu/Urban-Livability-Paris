ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjbFpINC1RRRAB,"Because the transportation was down while visiting this was the furthest location we visited by foot. From the Eiffel Tower it is about 1.5 hours walking and around 4 miles (6 KM). It is located north of Galerie Lafayette and as you pass it you’ll begin to notice the remaining walk will have an incline. As you approach the base from the street you’ll see plenty of open space leading up the stairs to the top along with a small carousel near the street. There is no cost to go in but there are donation boxes throughout the basilica if you prefer to leave some money. The hill upon which the basilica was built has been a religious site for centuries in France. The basilica itself has only been around for almost 200 years and contains a crypt underneath the ground level. As you pass the security to enter the basilica you’ll see the stairs that go down into the crypt. It is fairly elaborate and contains various artifacts along with information on the basilica and the history of it. All together it will take about 1-2 hours to see everything so it can be fit in during other daily activities. Nearby you can also find a popular colorful staircase leading up the back end of the basilica which many people also photograph while here. You can also stop by the Moulin Rouge which is less than a mile from here. Although it is a bit of a walk if the train isn’t working, it's worth stopping by to see especially now that Notre Dame is under construction. - @wanderingwithustwo",4 years ago,2024-12-28 17:13:22.693476,5.0,Wandering WithUsTwo,65,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116122213016549412331/reviews?hl=en
