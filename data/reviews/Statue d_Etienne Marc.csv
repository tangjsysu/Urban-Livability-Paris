ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNacmVMOW1nRRAB,"The Statue d'√âtienne Marcel is an equestrian statue of √âtienne Marcel, the Provost of the Merchants of Paris from 1355 to 1358. It is located on the south side of the H√¥tel de Ville de Paris, in the 4th arrondissement of Paris.  The statue was commissioned in 1882 and was completed in 1888. It was created by the sculptors Jean-Antoine-Marie Idrac and Laurent Marqueste. Idrac died in 1884, so Marqueste completed the statue based on Idrac's sketches and models.  The statue depicts Marcel in full armor, mounted on a rearing horse. He is holding a sword in his right hand and a scroll in his left hand. The scroll is inscribed with the words ""Pour le salut du peuple"" (For the salvation of the people).  Marcel was a popular figure in Paris during the 14th century. He was a champion of the common people and led a revolt against the dauphin, Charles, in 1358. He was assassinated by royalist supporters shortly after the revolt was crushed.  The Statue d'√âtienne Marcel is a reminder of Marcel's role in the history of Paris. It is also a symbol of the city's commitment to democracy and social justice.",a year ago,2025-02-09 15:05:31.519517,5.0,AbedAlrazaq Sultan,355,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105504847887509911237/reviews?hl=en-US
