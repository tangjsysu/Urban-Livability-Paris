Comprehensive security check with bag and body scanning (this is very good for everyone’s safety). The staff were very friendly. Once inside your eyes will be amazed. This chapel is beyond stunning. Beautiful stained glass around the entire chapel. When the sun shies it is just magical. It was crowded, but everyone was orderly and pleasant. So much history and such beautiful art work. The outside of the chapel is just amazing architecture and design. We loved our visit. This is a must see when in Paris.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQOGF5aW9RRRAB,"It's definitely awesome and worth the visit! Just be prepared for a long wait. That is  if you have tickets. I'm not sure how long it would be without a ticket. We had tickets for 11:30, got there about 10 minutes prior to that but got in after 12. The major delay is a security check. It's capacity is one person at a time, and it's not just a metal gate, it's like new detectors at the airport where you have to stand and wait while it scans you. Since the line is so far from the entrance it was not clear of the purpose of 3 lines. The first line is for people with no tickets, the second is for those whose can already enter, and the third is for those who got early or have to wait because people whose time was 30 minutes before didn't manage to get in yet.

The stairs are very old stone stairs. They go around up the tower. They are not even so it's easy to trip and there are a lot. If you are unable to do stairs you would not be able to see the upstairs stained glass. I would also use the bathroom before you go.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIMmVYb2ZnEAE,"We bought tickets in advance and still waited for an hour plus just to get in. Our reservation time was 1:30, we didn't get in till after 2:30. There are 3 lines for the queue in place. The markers are 20 feet from the check-in, and security is another 10-20 feet from there, so you need to be in the middle aisle if you're at the half pass reservation. Queue on the right aisle is for the 0 hour reservation. Queue on the left is if you don't have tickets.  So getting in took a while, and once you're in, there is a bag and body check, like the airport -  they check everything, including bags, camera, and phone. After you enter,  you can buy your tickets or scan your pre-purchased tickets. As you go into the 1st floor of the chapel, which is also the souvenir shop, you can spend about 5-10 minutes there. Go up the spiral staircase on the right when you face the entrance. Cautiously go up the tight and narrow spiral stairs to the 2nd floor, and that's where the stained glass and the beautiful ceiling are located. There's a walk out to the balcony, which oversees the grounds. You exit on the left side of the balcony, looking out at the balcony. Again,  caution going down the spiral staircase.  Waiting for an hour to have a 30-minute visit is not a great cost-benefit trade-off, but it's our first time to visit, and you need to bring your patience and manage your expectations. If you get the audio, you may be longer. For me,  it was worth the wait. 3 star because of the lack of logistics managing ticket  sales (I believe they oversell and is probably the cause of the delay).",3 months ago,2024-12-27 20:24:47.267519,3.0,P Lem,"1,039",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117847053705273787812/reviews?hl=en

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuek5QbXpnRRAB,"BOOK A TIMED TICKET. PMP is treated as ""no ticket"" here.  Absolutely not worth a 2 hour wait. If the line is to the corner of the building, it will be at least an hour to get in. Even with timed tickets, the wait was at least an hour. We arrived with our Paris Museum Pass and waited over 2 hours to get in.  There is only ONE staff member for the front of the museum. This man was checking tickets, running part of the line, AND putting stuff in security bins at the check. Security is VERY slow as there is only ONE metal detector, and it takes 5+ seconds per person. HIRE MORE EMPLOYEES! Overall, it was a very underwhelming experience, especially after visiting versaille or really any other cathedral (most are walk in and walk out, no absurd security or line). With that said, the inside is still stunning. The painted glass, statues, and overall feeling when being there is great. If you happen to pass by and the line is short, do it!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2ajZMOGJBEAE,"The Sainte-Chapelle in Paris is a breathtaking masterpiece of Gothic architecture and an absolute must-visit for anyone exploring the city. Nestled on the Île de la Cité, this historic gem is renowned for its awe-inspiring stained glass windows that cover nearly every inch of its upper chapel walls. These 15 towering panels depict over 1,000 biblical scenes, bathed in vibrant hues of blue, red, and gold, casting a kaleidoscope of colors that transform the space into a luminous sanctuary.  The craftsmanship and attention to detail in every corner are extraordinary, from the intricate carvings to the delicate tracery of the windows. Despite being a smaller and more intimate church compared to others in Paris, its grandeur lies in the serene and heavenly atmosphere it offers.  Visitors are often left speechless by the way sunlight interacts with the glass, creating a truly magical experience that feels almost otherworldly. The lower chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, is equally charming, with its richly painted ceilings and graceful columns.  Whether you’re an art lover, history enthusiast, or simply looking to be inspired, the Sainte-Chapelle is an unforgettable destination.
