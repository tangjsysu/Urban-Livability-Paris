Commissioned from the French visual artist Jean-Michel Othoniel for the centenary of the construction of the Paris Métro in 2000, installed the same year and inaugurated on October 30. The work takes the form of an installation having the function of a metro entrance. Outside, an aluminum metal mesh formed of rings linked to each other surrounds the staircase on three sides (apart from the one on which you can take it); it is set with a few rings of colored glass. Six columns made of aluminum spheres (three on each side of the mouth) support two domes. These domes are made up of a set of giant Murano glass beads (made by the Salviati glassworks) which appear to be strung together one after the other to form two dome-shaped structures. The dome which overlooks the entrance to the staircase is made of pearls in warm tones (yellow, white and red) and represents the day; the other has cold tones (blue, white, yellow and purple) and appears at night. Each of the domes is topped with a small sculpture of a glass figure. The back of the work includes a public bench, also made of aluminum. The interior part of the work, located shortly after the end of the staircase, contains two display cases embedded in the subway wall. They contain colored beads; one of the windows has warm tones, the other cold tones, like the two domes outside. In addition, the subway tiles at this entrance are painted a golden color; it finds its classic white color a little further on.",3 years ago,2025-01-24 12:23:27.131166,5.0,Jean Marco92,642,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114146936200095763256/reviews?hl=en
