ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqME5iczhnRRAB,"A really lovely and interesting museum, especially as it's free to visit, I would definitely recommend. The staff were friendly on the entrance, but there was one woman in the house that seemed a bit grumpy and wasn't rude with us, but was a bit rude with a few other visitors for no apparent reason. The artwork and exhibition was really well laid out and in a beautiful area though. There was a café on site which has a few bits if needed, and plenty of seating.

The staff, including security at the gate, is incredibly chill and lovely. The guy in the café has the kindest heart! There’s a very small gift shop.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaeGRDZFlBEAE,"The great thing about visiting Paris not for the first time, but in my case the 3rd time is that you get to go to these little charming museums at small mansions (just search “musée” on google maps! The city is littered in them)which in some ways are more enjoyable than the big important museums you see during your first time. This one has a small but charming collection of the art and personal effects of George Sand, the novelist. The garden beside the museum is very enjoyable as well - within the old (maybe original?) greenhouse that is a cottage core fantasy, you will find a small bar where you can order wine, coffee and some bottled drinks.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5MDVMc1VBEAE,"I went there in May 2023 during Françoise Pétrovitch’s exposition, it was quite interesting to see the way the artist included her colorful modern art pieces in this old house amongst the older paintings and furniture. I loved the contrast.  As to the permanent expositions, highly recommend visiting anytime (maybe not during the Olympics because it might be too crowed). I loved seeing some of George Sand’s property pieces and paintings done by her relatives. I also did not know she drew on top of writing (pretty cool). I also liked Ary Scheffer’s paintings (but George Sand has my undying love because of Fadette).",9 months ago,2024-12-28 15:55:43.534180,5.0,Fiona Degiovanni,12,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116374749943037654698/reviews?hl=en

Ary Scheffer used to live here too, his studio was here where he used to welcome his guests and where the artistic activity was in full swing in the 19th century in Paris. You can now admire different family possessions and nice paintings and sculptures made by their contemporaries. The museum is quite small, it takes less than an hour to fully visit it.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1OExyMWNBEAE,"Musée de la Vie Romantique or Museum of the Romantic Life is dedicated to the literary/cultural movement of Romanticism. A movement that gave absolute credibility to the author or painter's own emotions to create an experience through his art.  Entrance to the permanent exhibition is free.  The museum was formerly the main residence and studio of Ary Scheffer - a Dutch-French painter. There are two main buildings on the property, one the house and one the artist's studio.  Ary Scheffer was known to host intellectuals and artists of his time at his home. And this is what makes the museum special. You get to imagine a fragment of how it might have played out with artists and authors mingling, music being played, recitals. The list of the visitors to the house is impressive - George Sand (who was his neighbour), Ernest Renan (his niece's husband) Frederic Chopin, Eugene Delacroix, Franz Liszt, Gioacchino Rossini, Pauline Viardot and Charles Dickens! The museum has a little bit from a few of them. The main personalities focused are George Sand, Ernest Renan and ofcourse Ary Scheffer himself.  His studio also houses two breathtaking sculptures including one of Ammani Ammal, an Indian dancer, sculpted by Jean Auguste Barre!  The reason for one star less is that I would have loved to see more of the other visiting artists or maybe drawings of them together at the house to better weave their story.
