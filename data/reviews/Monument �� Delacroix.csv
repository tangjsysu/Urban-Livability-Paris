ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQc1BEVzlnRRAB,This fountain monument dedicated to French painter Eugene Delacroiz (1798-1863) is one of the more interesting of the over 100 monuments scattered around the Luxembourg Gardens. It is located in the northern section of the Gardens not far from the Palace and Rose Garden. The monument is the work of Aimé-Jules Dalou and was unveiled in 1890.  What you see is a bronze bust of Delacroix upon a pedestal which includes an allegorical scene with the Apollo applauding a figure of a winged man (Time) lifting up a woman (Fame) who places a wreath under Delacroix's bust. It is an expressive scene. The monument is centre of a small basin which surrounds and adds nice ambience.,a month ago,2024-12-27 21:21:34.543151,4.0,Brad,"5,430",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwNC02ZUVREAE,"I find this fountain very pretty, discreetly located on the edge of Little Luxembourg which is the current residence of the President of the Senate. It was erected by the friends of Eugène Delacroix to whom a tribute is paid here.  At the foot we find the genius of the arts with the laureate head who applauds. It is certainly Apollo because on the ground are the arrows and especially the lyre, here with goat horns, the symbol attached to the god and to the arts in general. The robust man on the left for whom time has visibly taken a toll on his hair since he is bald, despite his age, lifts, in the strict sense, a very pretty naked and voluptuous woman such as the sculptor Jules Dalou favored, who tends a palm by placing it in front of the bust of a Delacroix with a serious and impassive face looking straight ahead. There is no doubt that with this palm of the victors, it is Glory. So here we have Time which elevates Glory under the encouragement and applause of Apollo, genius of the arts, paying homage to Eugène Delacroix in a pretty curved momentum.",6 months ago,2024-12-27 21:21:34.545153,5.0,Cornelius 75,141,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112747992470828739526/reviews?hl=en-GB
