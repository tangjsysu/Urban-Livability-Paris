ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMaUxHUmJBEAE,"The Maillol Museum located in Paris, held the works of Andres Serrano. An American artist with controversial pieces of art. This exposition included portraits, sculptures, photographs, and more. All on the themes of race, gender, social class, and Christianity. Many people might feel offended by the art works, as they can be perceived as disrespectful and offensive. I would recommend this expostion to those who aren't easily offended or frighthened.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMdXRDOWRREAE,"I saw Andres Serrano's ""Portraits of America"" at my time at Musée Maillol. It is a pretty powerful photo exhibition that shows the diverse faces of American life. Serrano shows people from everywere in the USA; homeless individuals, veterans, celebrities etc. Showing their unique stories. His straightforward style makes you focus on the person, encouraging thoughts on issues like race, class, and identity. Some photos might be uncomfortable to see, such as lynching or nudity, but these push you to think deeper about society. Overall, it was an interesting experience that I found somewhat enjoyable, for its honest look at people in America today.",6 months ago,2024-12-28 15:58:29.984048,4.0,Paolo Chesneau,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103836326889561858845/reviews?hl=en
