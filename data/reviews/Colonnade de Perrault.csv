ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4dFpqdUN3EAE,Many times I would rush to the Louvre and like most was awestruck by the art and sculptures. It did not occur to me to walk around the grounds outside the main building. Not only was it breathtaking but there is no charge and very little crowds. If you have not seen this take a little extra time. It is really worth seeing and gives a whole new perspective.,a year ago,2025-01-24 12:57:07.554721,5.0,Louis and Elaine,"2,011",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111341191635673349312/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsbHFfMkl3EAE,"It is also worth seeing the Louvre from the outside, because it is not a typical simple museum building that does not stand out from the surrounding buildings. The Louvre Museum is already visible from a distance thanks to the beautiful Colonnade built on the model of ancient Roman temples, looking at this building you can forget and think that you are in Rome and not Paris. The colonnade was built at the end of the 17th century. The building will be a combination of architectural styles typical of France but combined with the style of ancient Italy. Additionally, the size of the building is really impressive, in my opinion visiting the Louvre itself requires at least three days, one of which is to visit only its external part, because it is very impressive.",a year ago,2025-01-24 12:57:15.857413,5.0,Zbigniew Ko≈ºuch,331,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108781237178982989196/reviews?hl=en
