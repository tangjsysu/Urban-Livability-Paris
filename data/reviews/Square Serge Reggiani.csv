Then there start to be too many people and small accidents become legion (jostles with open lips, bumps, etc...) In addition when it is hot you should know that this park is shaded until around 9:30 a.m. in summer and then in summer. late afternoon. There are 2 structures with slides suitable for children from 2 years old (in my opinion as soon as they can walk well) to 8 years old. Another downside: in the middle of the park, where there are the structures, there is a special covering to cushion falls, however around it is sand. As a result, the children are very dusty and tend to want to play in this sand even though there are regularly pieces of glass in it. The sand on the special coating causes many children to fall if they run because it becomes slippery and when it There's wind, it fills our eyes and lungs.
