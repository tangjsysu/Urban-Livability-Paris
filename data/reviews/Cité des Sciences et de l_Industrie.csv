School groups not only take all the space, as they are big groups, but are extremely noisy, with teachers and kids screaming the whole time. 13 euros each for the entry is a rip off! It was literally a fight for each and every room in order to be able to do any activity. It was just impossible to enjoy the experience. With around 50 kids there j every room at any given time, you just want to leave. And we actually left before the time was up.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYLWNtN1R3EAE,"There's nothing that inspires more the pursuit of science and a sense of wonder in technology than waiting in lines. After waiting in line to buy a ticket, be prepared to wait in line to access any part of the museum. Want to go upstairs? Line and show your ticket. You want the other side of the first floor? Line and show the ticket again. You also wait in line for separate exhibitions to be told that you should have reserved and that your children can't go in. How about a bite at the restaurant? Line, with no explanation why or for how long. We gave up after 15 minutes. The place looked at most 80% full.  The staff is polite and competent once you get to them, but everything moves at a glacial pace.  The exhibits we managed to see are OK. Not particularly well presented even when their ideas are fascinating. Be ready for a 6 min video where some gentleman in mutton chops explains to a little kid something that could be understood in a few seconds (and would benefit from something interactive and tactile). The videogame exhibit is just a bunch of video games you can play. Those are fun, of course, but we have them at home. There is no peek behind the curtain to explain what is needed to create them.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKbHZ2RVZnEAE,"Horrendous experience. From trying to find the convoluted  entrance to the parking lot in a dubious part of town, to the rude and incompetant staff to the broken, ageing exhibits--I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. We went straight to the information desk on arrival and asked how to buy tickets to the submarine and the planetarium. He motioned to the automatic ticket machines and said to buy a ticket to the expositions, which we did. On arrival at the submarine, the rude woman there told us that our ticket didn't work there. We eventually figured out that you have to line up for half an hour to get a créneau for almost every exhibition. By the time we found the entrance to the planetarium exhibit, it was 13h09 for our 13:00 1-hour time slot. The rude women said we were too late and to go line up (in the half-hour ticket line) again to get a créneau for 14h. There was no one there, and the digital sign said there were 148 places available in the planetarium. I asked how long it took to go through the exhibition, and she said about half an hour. I said that with our toddler, we move through exhibits faster than the average as we don't stop to read everything, so we didn't mind if we had a shorter timeslot. She was unmoved. We lined up for half an hour again to be told that there were no places left for 14:00. The whole place is old, broken and falling apart. The staff are rude. It is mismanaged and filthy. It should be condemned. We left without seeing the planetarium.
