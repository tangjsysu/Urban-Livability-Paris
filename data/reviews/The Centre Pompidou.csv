ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQb2NlWUh3EAE,It’s a nice place to hang out and take pictures. No need to take tickets to go up the escalator to the top floor. You need tickets to access any other floor.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzdkstVTFBRRAB,"The Centre Pompidou is an absolute must-visit for any art and culture enthusiast! The unique architecture, with its exposed pipes and industrial design, makes it one of the most recognizable landmarks in Paris. Inside, the collection of modern and contemporary art is vast and inspiring, featuring works from some of the greatest artists of our time.  I came across an abstract artwork featuring a bold combination of red and blue with circular accents. This striking piece feels both minimalistic and expressive. It’s a wonderful example of how simplicity can evoke powerful emotions and spark different interpretations.  I also appreciated the library and public spaces, which make the center feel welcoming and accessible.

Don't get me wrong, I do like the general architectural concept, I just don't think that the architecture in the exhibition rooms should distract from the artworks that are shown.
