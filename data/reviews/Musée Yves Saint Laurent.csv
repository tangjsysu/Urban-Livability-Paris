My first perfume I can remember was Rive Gouache  and that fragrance is still prevalent today. He was a true iconoclast.   His designs are as fresh and vibrant today, as they were in the 70, 90 and 90s. He was about making woman fell feminine and powerful in their own right.

I feel it's a kind of fraud as you have to pay once in there. It is not very costly but sadly not worth it. I don't recommend the visit as there is only few dresses not the most representatives from YSL... go to Dior or D&G they really worth the price and my recommendation to YSL museum change the information on your site to not misslead people... if only French people can have access to free tickets don't put that in English to confuse people.
