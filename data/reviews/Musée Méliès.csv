ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfaThmNnJBRRAB,My personal highlight while visiting Paris! Really wonderful exhibition on M√©li√®s for anyone interested in filmmaking. The temporary exhibition about James Cameron was well done and very interesting even for someone who doesn't enjoy his films as much. Some texts were only available in French but that's not too much of a problem overall. üòä,a month ago,2025-03-15 22:39:06.351580,5.0,Mage Craft,4,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113651458849543022426/reviews?hl=en-US
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQdFpQTlhREAE,"Georges M√©li√®s is one of my favorite film makers. The way he melded his magician background with new technologies to come up with special effects at the turn of the 1900s was nothing less that incredible.  This museum was great. Got to see a lot of original gear used by Georges as well as the history and background.  Larger placards are translated into English, but you will want to use Google Translate.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyN3RPTElnEAE,"A real discovery tour of the very initial stages of motion pictures. Meli√©s was the original master of special effects, and the museum shows how he brought his knowledge of magic, theater, production, and the new motion cameras all together to create movies with fantastic scenes that people could not believe.  For years, he was the chief inventor of special effect techniques such as stop motion and mattes. Then, he was the inventor of the concept of the motion picture studio, erecting a dedicated building. His studio was  like a greenhouse and a classic theater all in one, optimized to capture the sun's light to make the production of films easier before electric lights were a practical tool.  This exhibit was inside the Cin√©math√®que, which also featured a temporary exhibit about James Cameron's creative genius. This too was exceedingly interesting.",7 months ago,2025-03-15 22:39:06.353922,5.0,Derek Kerton,180,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107761297884639198094/reviews?hl=en-US
