ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bE1uaGlnRRAB,"Relative to other gardens and parks in and around Paris this place is underwhelming. The use of ""Jardin"" seems to be a stretch as there is much much more grass than garden and plantings are few. It is in the middle of major, busy roads so it is a noisy area. Lots of benches to sit and eat your lunch as many locals come here to do. There is a puppet theatre, a children's playground, paths for walking and cycling, lots of grassy spaces for picnics.
