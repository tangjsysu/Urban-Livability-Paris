ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQaGFIbHRBRRAB,"This is part of the green space in the 6th arrondissement in between the Luxemburg Gardens (north) and the Garden of the Great Explorers (south). Here you will find a handful of monuments of romanticism and each peculiarly named after a time of the day. There are also walking lanes, flower beds, rows of trees on each side and benches if you fancy a seat and rest while passing through the esplanade.  If you plan to visit the Luxembourg Gardens and are coming from the south, you will pass through both the Garden of the Great Explorers and Esplanade Gaston Monnerville and can have a look around then before proceeding into the very impressive Luxembourg Gardens.",a month ago,2025-01-24 12:13:39.778392,3.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB
