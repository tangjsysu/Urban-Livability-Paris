Loved the fact that at the entrance we were greeted with small chocolate boxes and also were given a ticket for a free drink to be enjoyed after the museum visit ends.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaVByUmtBRRAB,This was a good place to spend thirty to forty minutes. It goes through the history and value placed on cocoa beans. It was interesting and there were little stations that gave visitors the opportunity to taste some chocolate buttons. The option to have a hot chocolate at the end of the tour for an extra three euros wasn't really worth it as they didn't have many flavours left. We had to make do with white chocolate which was super sweet. Too sweet for either of us to drink much more than two or three sips. The huge exhibits of the Eiffel tower and the fashion made from chocolate was worth a look but I don't think this museum is worth the admission prices they're charging.,2 years ago,2025-03-15 21:57:59.780316,3.0,Nicole McCurdy,53,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117050486300037562863/reviews?hl=en-US

It was fun to walk through the bottom floor exhibit on the indigenous and colonial roots of chocolate, and taste some of the first recipes; there are samples along the way! On the top floor, we learned more about the European history, and the colonial interaction, burgeoning markets, and plethora of different industrial artifacts, art, and ads that appeared as chocolate conquered the continent and North America. Every 20 minutes there is a demonstration of chocolate making on the bottom floor. We attended and were delighted by the friendly, enthusiastic, and welcoming exhibition. It tasted excellent, too!
