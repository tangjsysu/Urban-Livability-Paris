ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYbi1PUnNRRRAB,Wow! Have been meaning to visit here for so long and was really worth the visit. Slight queue to get in but moved quickly. Wide and interesting selection of books. The upstairs reading room is a good place to have a little sit and read a purchase and take in the decor. It was quite busy when we went so be careful of backpacks! The cafe was also a good place for a welcome refreshment.,a month ago,2024-12-28 15:08:03.524735,5.0,BeardyFred 79,73,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106931228607465009232/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3dDU3dTdRRRAB,"I love this bookstore so much! It's so cozy and chill; I love going there just for the experience. This place inspires me to read and write—it's like every writer and reader's dream come true.  Unfortunately for this review (but very fortunately for the integrity and ambiance of the bookstore itself, in my opinion—it's a way of preserving its charm), taking pictures inside is not allowed. I personally really appreciate the variety of languages spoken due to the presence of many tourists; it’s music to my ears (granted, I’m very passionate about languages). Don’t get me wrong, though—it’s not noisy inside at all; on the contrary, it’s a very calm place.  The staff are very friendly, though a few might not be as personable. The only minor hiccup is that, since it’s an English bookshop in Paris, if you speak both French and English, you might feel a bit unsure about which language to use when interacting with them. This can make me personally anxious—I tend to avoid interactions altogether, haha. But this isn’t a downside at all, just a quirky observation.  If you’re visiting Paris and love books, Shakespeare and Company is an absolute must, in my opinion!",3 months ago,2024-12-28 15:08:03.526736,5.0,Joan Breval,9,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107225481756862350914/reviews?hl=en
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiLTRhYW93RRAB,"One of my all time favourite places in Paris. An old bookstore, established in 1951 where loads of famous authors also came to visit.  Shakespeare and company has two stores, one for new books and one for old preloved ones and there is also a cafe on the left that offers everything from breakfast to afternoon cakes, also a lot of vegan options and vegan milk for the coffee specialities.  All of the books that you can purchase here are written in English and the staff speaks english as well. I got a copy from hamlet there that was bilingual (english and French) and the last time I visited I bought a book from the antiquarian part of SaC. I was very seduced to also buy a copy of the complete works of Shakespeare which arrived just that day but I feared that my bag would get too heavy so I didn't do it haha.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuaDZLV1RBEAE,"Disregard those that mock you for doing the tourist thing by visiting this iconic bookshop with a reputation for having helped launch the writing careers of such greats as James Joyce.  First opened by Sylvia Beach in 1919, the Parisian institution was frequented by writers including Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Eliot and Joyce in the early 20th century. The shop was nicknamed ""Stratford-on-Odéon"" by Joyce, who used it as his office. Beach published Joyce's book Ulysses in 1922. Apparently these literary greats would write and hang out here and sometimes even use it as a crash pad.  Go here and browse the books for sale then head upstairs and read or write in a cozy corner.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2dktYVVh3EAE,"One employee in particular was extremely rude. The place is very popular and touristy. Hence, the reason why so many tourists like to take pictures of themselves as a souvenir. The shop policy is not to take photos so to respect others’ privacy. I was informed by this when I was holding my tripod and I apologized for that. However having being in a corner of the shop with no customers or employees around, I snapped a photo as a souvenir to keep for my own self. Visiting this place was on my bucket list. The last thing I wanted is to invade people’s privacy, but I wanted to keep a special memory for myself. While paying my bill at the counter, the employee asked me in an angry tone to delete the video in front of other customers because apparently he was watching me through the camera the whole time. He wouldn’t budge from my side until I have paid my bill. I explained that it was only a photo of my face. He proceeded to demand me to delete it because he was claiming he was in the background! He was staring at my phone and at one point I thought he’d snatch my phone from me and attempt to delete it himself. He escorted me to the door like I was some theirs. He said he doesn’t want his face on social media. I explained that I’m not planning to post his face in my socials, why would I even wanna do that. I understand his viewpoint, but being talked to in that angry tone as if I am a criminal of some sort was not in my expectations while planning to visit this place. I informed him later that I was spoken to in a disrespectful way. He continued to show attitude and tell me that’s because I have no respect. He didn’t apologize once for the way he addressed me.
