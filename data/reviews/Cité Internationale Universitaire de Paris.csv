ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURncUpQczBnRRAB,"This is for the Maison Heinrich- Heine:  The building is very well equipped, with a cafe, large library (great place to study) and very kind staff. Unfortunately, it's really a place for undergraduate level students, as the ambience is more akin to a dorm than a place to truly live. The noise level is outrageous, with people having parties or being inconsiderate with their talking/ music in the hallways. The walls are so thin that I can hear someone cough in the room next door, so you can only imagine how bad it is when someone has a few guests! The cleanliness of the common areas leaves much to be desired, as many of the residents seem incapable of living as adults and cleaning up after themselves. The kitchen on my floor was always filthy, and the Maison doesn't supply dish liquid or sponges :/ The toilet and showers were also pretty gross, especially over the weekend. It reminded me of elementary school, where people weren't 100% used to using the toilet on their own. Yet these are ""adults"", young, but still adults.  The price was 410 for younger than 29 and 460 for older, which isn't bad for Paris, but I expect to live comfortably (sanitary conditions and no excessive noise) for that amount. The house is also quite far in the back of campus, which means it takes almost 10 minutes to get to the RER station on foot. When the weather is bad (there is only 1 paved road) it can be a really messy and long walk.  Overall, it's better than being homeless (and there is maid service), but having to wear ear plugs all the time to just study or read in my room, isn't any way to live.",11 years ago,2025-01-24 14:01:04.849070,2.0,Bebe T.
