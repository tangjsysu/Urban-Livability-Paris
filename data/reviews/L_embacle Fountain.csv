It is formed by the floor blocks, which have risen as if pushed by an underground force.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTOHIzM2hRRRAB,"The L'Embâcle Fountain is a Fountain located in Paris (6th), Place du Québec at the intersection of Rue de Rennes, Rue Bonaparte and Boulevard Saint-Germain, district of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. It is opposite the Café de Flore and the Café Les Deux Magots, not far from the Brasserie Lipp on the same side of the sidewalk. Place du Québec inaugurated in 1980. It was in 1984 that this work by Quebec artist Charles Daudelin (1920 – 2001) was offered “as a tribute from Quebec to the city of Paris”. The Fountain is made up of several more or less curved bronze plates which extend the surrounding sidewalk. This continuity gives the impression that the sidewalk is lifted by the water emerging from it. The name “jam” refers to the obstruction of the bed of a watercourse by a massive pile of ice. The fountain thus symbolizes the time of year when the winter ice releases the gushing waters of the St. Lawrence and the rivers of Quebec. Sculpture composed of 4 bronze elements which seem to be lifted by the flow, piercing the pavement slabs as the waters of the Saint Lawrence pierce the ice at the time of thaw, L'Embâcle evokes the forces of nature, the bubbling of vital energies within the work during the spring breakup. 8 m long, 6 m wide, 1.90 m high, this fountain is rather discreet during the day collected on the ground from which it gently emerges in the continuity of the pink sandstone plates. Illuminated in the evening, it reveals itself in plays of geometry, mineral angles and metallic shine reminiscent of broken frost, between abstract and figurative art, an architectural element that has become essential. Offered by the Quebec government, L'Embâcle was inaugurated on October 25, 1984 on the occasion of the festivities of the 450th anniversary of the discovery of Canada by the navigator Jacques Cartier and renovated in 2011.",4 years ago,2025-02-09 14:53:37.393827,5.0,Jean Marco92,640,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114146936200095763256/reviews?hl=en-US
