ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzMzRfc3BRRRAB,This museum shows the artifacts from the Indochina region. It has a really nice park next to it.  It takes around 1 hour to go around the whole museum and one can visit on one of the weekends if he tends to stay in Paris for a long time.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzbHZibHN3RRAB,"The Cernuschi Museum, a hidden gem near Parc Monceau, offers a captivating journey into Asian art through the remarkable collection amassed by Henri Cernuschi. Established over 125 years ago in 1898, this museum now holds over 15,000 artefacts, primarily from China and Japan, with additional pieces from Korea and Vietnam.  The vastness and diversity of the collection are astonishing, especially considering it stems from a single collector's dedication. The museum houses a comprehensive range of Chinese art, from archaic bronze pieces dating back to the 15th century BCE to intricate Tang dynasty ceramics and unique funerary masks from the Liao dynasty. The 18th-century Japanese Buddha of Meguro is a centrepiece among 900 objects permanently on display.  With free entry to its permanent collection and thoughtful accessibility features, this museum offers an exceptional opportunity to appreciate Asian art and history. A must-visit for anyone in Paris, the Cernuschi Museum is an extraordinary testament to one man’s passion for art and culture.",4 months ago,2025-03-15 22:51:19.556391,4.0,Muhammad Haque,547,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105179506843017317153/reviews?hl=en-US
