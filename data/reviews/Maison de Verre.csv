If you’re in related to the field of architecture and design, it is possible for you to get a tour. Otherwise, I’m not sure. Book months in advance!!! This is a beautiful home and I still dream about it.  Pictures of the inside are prohibited and there are areas you will not be able to tour. It’s very strict.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNckw2Qjd3RRAB,Thank you so much to the owners for allowing people to come visit this architectural gem!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2cTl2VEhREAE,"One of the most beautiful houses in Paris, an icon of modernism, is hidden so well inside the 7th arrondissement that even true architecture buffs pass by. La Maison de Verre – Glass House. It was designed by Pierre Chareau in 1930 for the physician Jean Dalsace. In the 1920s, he acquired an 18th-century mansion. The elderly lady on the top floor refused to sell her apartment. Dalsas, not wanting to get bogged down in litigation, demolished only the bottom 3 floors, preserving the neighbor's original top floor. So the glass house was integrated into the contours of the old building. Pierre Chareau was obsessed with new technologies: the use of a steel frame allowed the house to have an open layout and replace load-bearing blank walls with glass ones. 100 years ago this shocked the public. Inside, the space is crammed with mechanisms that still work today. In the 30s, the house was chosen by Parisian bohemians.",3 days ago,2024-12-27 21:09:55.754459,5.0,Sun Power,78,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108552564015995743065/reviews?hl=en
