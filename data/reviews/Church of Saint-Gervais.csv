ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyNlppY05REAE,Beautiful and serene church. Not a touristy place so the serenity is kept. We didnâ€™t go during a mass so the place was quiet and so peaceful. The place is also accessible and is very near some tourist places such as the Notre Dame.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnbk9iOFF3EAE,The church community is wonderful. You can feel their joy for the Lord in the mass. The mission of the church is to bring more prayer to the city there are three prayer services a day. The beautiful music during these services are worth attending. A beautiful welcoming church.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5MUxYSzd3RRAB,"A very interesting combination of Baroque style (the facade) and the Gothic styles (the interior and the altar apse). It was restored in the last years. It is an amazing well preserved church. Madame de Maintenon's first husband, the French poet and humanist, the crippled Scaron, had the honor of being buried here. He was a regular of the Marais Salon. The stain glasses, the statues, the Gothic vaults, evrything is nice Definitely worth a visit.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWNV91X1hREAE,"I found this church by chance while wandering around Paris. One of the things I liked most about the churches of Paris is the stained glass windows, painted in an attractive way.  Apart from the churches that tourists visit most of the time, the Gothic-style church of Saint-Gervais-Saint-BrÃ´tÃ© is worth a visit as it is located near the town hall.  Construction of the church began in 1494, and it took about 150 years to build.",a year ago,2024-12-27 20:11:49.974322,5.0,Mohammad Ayoub,230,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102613109672441235778/reviews?hl=en

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnM3VTZ2d3RRAB,"On a long walk though the area, we approached the church from the back and realized it was one we had never before visited. We entered and spotted a handful of sisters in their grey and white habits as well as a number of worshippers on their knees with their foreheads to the stone floor, praying. As we walked quietly through the church, we realized the sisters and several monks were preparing for a service. We sat at the back of the church as the dozen or so members of the orders began singing. It was hard to believe that the music was not recorded, but that they were singing a capella. Although not religious, we were entranced by the 20 minutes or so of the service that we watch.",8 years ago,2024-12-27 20:11:49.975322,5.0,Yi Jian,226,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107720693328277357629/reviews?hl=en

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURBeE5lLU9nEAE,"From a musical point of view, this church is a must-see (and must HEAR), because the pipe organ is the very instrument upon which members of the famous Couperin family of composers played from 1600 until the 1820s. The vast majority of the stops, and their associated pipework, are original from the 17th and 18th century, with only four using new pipework from the modern era.  Because of restorations which, necessarily, took place after the time of the Couperins, the instrument is not exactly the same as it was in the Baroque era: but the sounds you will hear when the instrument are played are highly authentic. This will give performers and listeners a good insight into the performance practice necessary to play Couperin, and other French Early music, in authentic style.  The staff in this church were friendly on the occasion of my recent visit.",8 years ago,2024-12-27 20:11:54.131924,4.0,John Warburton,457,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106144388905866253482/reviews?hl=en
