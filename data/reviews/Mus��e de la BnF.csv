ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzaFB2ZFd3EAE,A very beautiful museum and library in Paris. I would say THE BEST. They have manuscripts from several regions over the world. I saw rigveda and Mahabharata for the first time in my Life in this museum. They also display a lot of French culture. It also has a really beautiful library. A must visit when in Paris.,a month ago,2024-12-28 16:11:41.628243,5.0,Rahul Agarwal,230,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118183620553811056026/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqcWZDandnRRAB,The Museum of the Bibliothèque de France (Library of France) covers humanity and culture. So precious objects that tell the story of humanity's evolution are here. The reading room is equally as impressive: arts and culture are covered as well as a great section for kids.,8 months ago,2024-12-28 16:11:41.628243,5.0,Pak-Ming Wan,202,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100897246722939510425/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3cWNITWVBEAE,"A phenomenal little museum in a beautiful library! I'm not usually an antiquities person but their collection is magnificent. The interactive displays were so well done that it actually made me interested in red-figure pottery! The temporary exhibit on revolutions in Paris was a master class in museum design and very informative as an American whose knowledge of French history begins and ends in the 1790s. In addition to its collections, the library is full of wonderful architecture from the 17th through 21st centuries; I stared at the mythology frescoes on the ceiling of the Mazarin Gallery for a good 20 minutes.  Not a ""must-see"" like the Louvre or Musée d'Orsay, but if you're a museum nerd like me, you'll have a great time. Plus it's free if you're under 26!",4 months ago,2024-12-28 16:11:41.628243,5.0,Kelly Corless,6,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105224734056390663280/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURydTlDWHhRRRAB,I've been there by coincidence. If you're under 26 and live in Europe you can enter for free apparently.

There were valuable items on display, including paintings depicting the Bastille, where the French Revolution began, and handwritten musical scores by Mozart and Beethoven.
