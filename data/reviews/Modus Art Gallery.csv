ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtM0xyRGpRRRAB,"Good morning Thank you for your response. And what do you think about turning off your lights as soon as your store closes, especially the very powerful lights (halogen?) that illuminate the exterior wall? Some galleries on the square, for example, only light the works on display and with LEDs. ---- Hello, I could see when passing your store that the lights were on, even after closing. However, since October 2022, it has been illegal to leave a window or commercial sign lit after 1 a.m. This is due to the energy crisis we are going through and which has a direct impact on our climate. Therefore, I invite you to turn off your lights in order to respect the law, but also to help save our planet. If everyone does their part, it will have a positive impact on our collective carbon footprint.",2 years ago,2024-12-28 16:21:05.160798,5.0,Aymeril Hoang,117,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103968069935775938143/reviews?hl=en
