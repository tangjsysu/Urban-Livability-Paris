ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQza3VfU2d3RRAB,There are a number of statues within the grounds of the garden. A number depict nude female forms and are mostly coloured green. Some are reclining whilst others are standing. A few are quite obvious and some are hidden amongst the trimmed bushes.,2 months ago,2025-01-24 11:25:52.214114,5.0,Mike Day,337,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101631451196518773367/reviews?hl=en
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzcktlNkpnEAE,"This is one of the Maillot sculptures situated within the Jardin du Carrousel area between the Louvre and Tuileries Gardens. Created by Aristide Maillol (1937-38) and installed here in 1964, what you see is a female lying in a reclined position, leaning on her right arm while looking into the distance. The work is dedicated to the aviation pioneers of the Aeropotale (mail) service for the city of Toulouse.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 11:25:52.214114,3.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en
