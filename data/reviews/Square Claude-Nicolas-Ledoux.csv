ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYOHZxXzl3RRAB,"This is one of three small public square gardens just off of Place Denfert Rochereau in the Montparnasse area of the city. The square was built in 1894 in the manner of an English Garden and dedicated to French architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux (1736-1806).  There is a double circle walking path through the square, some grassy space, a couple of flower beds as well as an interesting monument dedicated to Ludovic Trarieux (1840-1904) that you can see here.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 11:47:18.186088,3.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6N3JxX3hnRRAB,"Very unsafe park for women and children. Went twice, once at 6pm, and there were groups of men shouting and being very scary, then went at 9am, daylight, people around, and there was a man masturbating in one of the benches. Next to him a homeless man laguhing. There’s no security and since you can’t see inside from outside I don’t recommend passing through it. Not worth it.",7 months ago,2025-01-24 11:47:18.187088,1.0,Julia Anelli,2,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109856565896555977766/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxZ2ZyQUp3EAE,"Very pretty little square very close to one of the exits of the Denfert-Rochereau metro station, with lots of benches and beautiful lawns to sit on. It bears the name of the French architect Claude Nicolas Ledoux (1736-1806) who was on the one hand one of the main inspirations of the neoclassical style and on the other hand the creator of the wall of the General Farmers whose nearby barrier Hell was one of the elements. The square is decorated in its center with a statuary group dedicated to Ludovic Trarieux (1840-1904), French politician, founder and first president of the French League for Human Rights. Sculpted by Jean Boucher... The square was generally well attended, except for a group of 3 individuals who played their music loudly, probably assuming that everyone enjoyed the same music as them....",3 years ago,2025-01-24 11:47:18.190090,5.0,Fred Booker,495,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115485660678768601234/reviews?hl=en-GB
