ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqMG9yU0lREAE,"From the gardens of the Palais Royal starts the Gallerie Vivienne, then the Passage des Panoramas, then the Passage Jouffroy and finally the Passage Verdeau. The Passage Verdeau, inaugurated in 1846, is essentially an extension of the Passage des Panoramas and the Passage Jouffroy. The truth is that this Passage was always considered subordinate to the two previous ones and that was the reason why it remained empty and neglected for many years.
