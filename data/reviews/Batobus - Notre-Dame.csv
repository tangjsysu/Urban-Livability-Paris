ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3eEp1Rmt3RRAB,"Such an amazing, relaxing way to see the sights of Paris! After several days of walking the city, we were footsore and HOT, so we took Batobus as a way to cool off and see anything we had missed. We were able to easily hop on and off to visit anything we wanted to without any time pressure, and the stops were all within easy distance of the sites we wanted to see. The view from the Seine was unbeatable, and the staff both on land and on water were friendly and helpful.",4 months ago,2024-12-28 16:32:44.751982,5.0,Li C.,3,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110481154863327398320/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1dG9HbWxnRRAB,"Best money you will spend in Paris is getting a one or two-day Batobus pass. Takes two hours to do a complete circuit on the Seine River if you just stay on board, or hop on and off as many times as you like during your pass. No bad seats. Great fun. Super convenient and clean. Pluse you get to see things from the river that you might not other see unless you buy a more expensive river cruise.

Two boats came and went without us as they didn't have enough spaces left. Beautiful way to travel and to see the landmarks. It was also fun to people watch, there was so much going on along the river bank.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwN01DZWh3RRAB,"To be honest, there is not a good or bad review, it depends on the staff involved that day and time. Some of them helped me and my family to go into the boat and other ignored me in the most disrespectful way, sadly the most of them were disrespectful.  As a mom I would recommend to assess the “stroller situation” I have a double Cross from THULE, is so freaking practical for traveling and I love it, but if your children are sleeping is better to wait for the boat, because the personal forced me to folded up and placed in a corner, later on they move it and it was just for annoying us, the space was too big.  I guess my expectations were too high, I went to Germany before and everything was stroller or wheels friendly but the door of the train. Traveling with children is amazing and I had a nice time in Paris, but the “Batobus experience” was something I regretted a lot, and Paris is not that pretty from the river level though.  never stop traveling with children:)  The end of the story, my daughter’s stroller was completely wet after the trip:(",a year ago,2024-12-28 16:32:44.757930,1.0,Eve,3,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103738649003368093801/reviews?hl=en

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6Z2JyTFZBEAE,"The Batobus is somewhere between a sightseeing tour and a mode of transportation, but I would not say it excels at either. The grimy, opaque windows limit visibility from the interior of the boat. On a cold or rainy day, the condensation completely obscures the view out the window. There is a small back deck, but you will be exposed to the sound and fumes of the engine.  I would recommend the Batobus for someone who definitely plans to use all or most of the stops. But if you are only trying to hit up one or two, you would be better off taking the Metro. If you really want the best view of Paris from the river, look for a boat with cleaner windows, or one that sits higher on the water.",6 months ago,2024-12-28 16:32:44.759930,2.0,Angus Black,132,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112233904899348576346/reviews?hl=en
