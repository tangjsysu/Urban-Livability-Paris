ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyN3BLS1JBEAE,"Is it the cheapest or fastest way to get around Paris? No. But if you want to experience being on the Seine in an all glass-covered boat (albeit warm in full sun during the summer) while famous monuments like the Eiffel Tower, Musee de Orsay & Louvre, and Notre Dame Cathedral pass you by, then hop on board!  For us, it was a nice ~10 min ride after visiting the Musee d’Orsay to conveniently hop on there to go to Notre Dame Cathedral/Ile St. Louis/Shakespeare & Co.  From about where the famous clock of the Musee d’Orsay, there is a ramp that leads down to the river/Batobus Stn.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaN0k3U0VnEAE,"The Batobus is a boat service along the River Seine in the Paris region. The name is a trademark of Bateaux Parisiens.  The Batobus, as its name implies, is a boat (bateau in French, pronounced ""ba-TOW"") that operates like a bus. With nine stops in the center of Paris, it allows you to travel from one part of the city to another, while enjoying the scenery along the way.  With your ticket, you can remain on the boat for an entire loop (roughly 1.5 to 2 hours) or you can hop on and off at any of the nine stops along the Seine River to explore Paris.  It runs Monday – Thursday: 10 am – 5 pm (a boat leaves every 45 mins) Friday – Sunday: 10 am – 7 pm (a boat leaves every 20 mins in summers and  30 mins in winters)  While purchasing tickets we were told that you can get discounts if you have Navigo card/pass which is weekly travel card that can be issued at the station. We didn’t had any so didn’t enquire further but if you have one do check if any offer.",a year ago,2024-12-28 16:29:21.954207,4.0,Deepa P,416,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115654292526495242532/reviews?hl=en-GB

Instead of having pleasant ride we were trying to call this number by the way which was wrong. I came back to staff and she told me to dial in front of me and of course number didn't work when she tried either. They said I have to write a letter to this company to get my money back.
