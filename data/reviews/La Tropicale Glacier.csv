ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVanRMdHZRRRAB,"Located very close to the metro station Place d'Italie, this ice-cream shop stands out by the originality of the suggested flavors. Quality and/or authenticity has a price but it does not end up being a rip-off (to answer some of the past reviews). Few seating options indoor and outdoor. On top of ice cream, the spot offers a lunch menu. On the service side, we found the person in charge welcoming and keen to explain what is actually sold.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1czhLNUFREAE,"La Tropicale Glacier's, Yuzu-Espelette, is the single best cone of ice cream I have eaten in my entire life. No exaggeration. The term ""artisanal"" is often overused or misused, but certainly not in this case. During my month-long stay near the trendy (but not touristy) Bastille area, I revisited La Tropicale no less than 10 times. IF my first choice was not available that particular day, my close-second, Coconut Sesame, was¬†to be perfectly enjoyed. The daily revolving of artisanal ice cream flavors are made by a true Japanese chef and artist, Naomi, drawn upon La Tropicale Glacier's generationally family-owned recipes...as well as Naomi's own contributions. I suspect Yuzu-Espelette was her concoction. In speaking to the lovely owner, Thai Thanh, and her daughter during my many visits, it was apparent that great care and love is infused in every recipe, every flavor, every delicious offering.

Come back at another time !‚Äù  We were so taken aback by the aggressiveness of the response that we left. However, I would like to point out to you Madam that when you put yourself on the Food Trip, therefore, you tacitly agree to play the game. Furthermore, if you had told us with (much) more politeness and a smile, we could have perfectly understood. You could also have offered just a scoop of ice cream instead of the tasting of the six flavors proposed in the guide. This would have saved you time and we would have been able to discover your products which also looked very good and with original scents. Because by purchasing the food trip, we implicitly pay a small contribution to what we buy in each of the participating stores and as it is the game, this brings you a clientele that you would not necessarily have reached.
