Otherwise, use public transport, get dropped off by car or park in town. In 1899, the author Georges Harmois and the feminist journalist Marguerite Durand, director of the newspaper La Fronde, founded the French Anonymous Society of the Cemetery for Dogs and Cats. This company acquired land on an island in the Seine, the √éle des Ravageurs. The cemetery then accommodates the remains of domestic animals, dogs, cats or birds but also other animals including horses or lions. Some have imposing vaults or monuments. It is written on the frontispiece of the building ‚ÄúCIMETIERE des CHIENS‚Äù and yet, there are also numerous cats there, the 2 species alone representing 95% of the tenants. Rental only of bare land, renewable, to which must be added the annual concession cost, burial costs and the masonry of the funerary monument. After a risk of closure in 1987, the Town Hall of Asni√®res-sur-Seine became the owner in 1989 and has managed it since 1997. There are officially 849 dealers from all over France and a few from abroad to pay a final tribute to their companion. 90,000 animals were buried here! On September 21, 2019, the cemetery's 120th anniversary was celebrated with the inauguration of the sculpture Alter Ego, created by Asni√©ro artist Arnaud Kasper, representing several animals. BARRY: Monument to the glory of this¬†Alpine spaniel, predecessor of the Saint Bernard, erected by the cemetery management. This dog born in 1800 and died in Bern in 1814 belonged to the canons of the Grand Saint Bernard hospice and is said to have saved the lives of 40 people. According to a legend, killed by the 41st, one night, a Napoleonic soldier lost in the middle of a storm when he saw him thought he recognized a wolf and in a panic killed him. In reality, Barry died at the age of 14 in Bern where he had lived his last two years. Stuffed body preserved and exhibited in Bern. RINTINTIN: movie dog of which one of the descendants, Rintintin IV, was the famous actor in the television series. MEMERE: a small stone dog extends its paw to a helmeted soldier. Born in 1914, she remained the mascot of the foot hunters for fifteen years. Monument in memory of police dogs. The 40,000th animal to be buried there was a stray dog ‚Äã‚Äãwho came to die at the cemetery gate in 1958. The cemetery management erected a monument to him. Thanks to numerous restoration works, the cemetery continues to receive dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, turtles, mice, hamsters, fish, horses, and even lion, monkey, gazelle, fennec, lemur, whose tombs are richly sculpted or simply flowers show the affection of their master. Living cats have their own domain, ‚Äúthe cat house‚Äù, maintained by an association which provides them with assistance.",3 years ago,2024-12-27 20:08:20.253297,5.0,Jean Marco92,643,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114146936200095763256/reviews?hl=en
