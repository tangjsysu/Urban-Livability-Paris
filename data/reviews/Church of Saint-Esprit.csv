ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzMTh5U3hRRRAB,"Enter almost by chance into this church, built entirely of bricks seen from the outside, and come across a magnificent monument inspired by the Byzantine style. The dome which overlooks the building with its 33 meters height and 22 meters in diameter takes our breath away and the omnipresence of the raw concrete lit only by the stained glass windows is soothingly heavy. The frescoes can be seen in the darkness and only the one behind the altar seems to pierce the darkness. We emerge somewhat disturbed by the light of day and the rhythm of life outside. We will remember the unique style of this church.",a month ago,2024-12-27 20:40:20.633034,5.0,Paul FEAT,36,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103686778620835877959/reviews?hl=en

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNOTdYcGdBRRAB,"The Church of the Holy Spirit on Avenue Daumesnil is the most important achievement of the “Chantiers du Cardinal” entrusted to the architect Paul Tournon in 1928 and consecrated in 1935. The church is built on an irregular plot nestled in the middle of residential buildings, hence the discretion of the building from the public road. The surprise is all the greater when you discover the vast and mysterious interior space. Paul Tournon chose the reference to the great Byzantine churches, notably Saint Sophia of Constantinople. The choice of this style was certainly far from being new since the construction of the Sacré-Coeur de Montmartre in the 1880s, but the innovation comes from the use of raw concrete which gives the building an unprecedented sincerity if we except the work of Auguste Perret, a little earlier for the Church of Raincy and undoubtedly more in agreement in its plasticity with the mechanical performance of concrete. However, the transposition from stone to concrete offers a unique and touching example from the interwar period. A number of artists collaborated on the construction of the church, notably Carlo Sarrabezolles for the exterior sculptures on concrete, Louis Barillet, Paul Louzier and Jean Hébert-Stevens for the stained glass windows, Jean Gaudin and Marcel Imbs for the mosaics, Raymond Subes for the ironwork and Jean Dunand for the liturgical furniture. Maurice Denis and George Desvallières in particular will ensure the pictorial program of the church.",5 years ago,2024-12-27 20:40:24.831247,3.0,Christophe Niel,55,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100922622129351805481/reviews?hl=en
