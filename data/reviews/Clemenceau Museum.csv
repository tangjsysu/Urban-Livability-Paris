ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOV9mc0d3EAE,"Small museum but no crowds at all. You start the visit with second floor, which is very much text and photo based. Then you go to first floor which is where Clemenceau used to live, and I think this is the interesting part of the museum. It is a very subjective museum though, it doesn't portray Clemenceau with both his positives and negatives but pretty much only positives. This must be because the museum is found and run by the Clemenceau foundation.",a year ago,2024-12-28 16:13:18.447341,3.0,Erhan Erdem,18,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106210297121446940948/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlLWEtZFVREAE,"This is a museum where Georges Clemenceau, the French Prime Minister during World War I, lived in an actual apartment from 1896 to his death. On the first floor there are records about him (newspapers, paintings, letters etc), and on the ground floor you can see the dining room, bedroom, bureau and garden.  He is known for his distinctive mustaches and photographs of tigers and Clemenceau's words below the museum paintings stand out.  <<Il faut savoir ce que l'on veut. Quand on le sait, il faut avoir le courage de le dire. Et quand on le dit, il faut avoir le courage de le faire.>> (You have to know what you want.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5NjlEc0xREAE,"Very pleasant and interesting discovery of the Cl√©menceau museum! Here is a historic Parisian place that is little known but deserves to be. This is where Georges Clemenceau lived from 1896 until his death on November 24, 1929, and since that date nothing has changed! Which is what makes this museum so charming. On the ground floor, his (small) four-room apartment with adjoining garden (incredible to think that at the time this member of the middle bourgeoisie still had a valet, a cook and a driver at his service) . And on the first floor a permanent exhibition clearly retraces the key stages of the Tiger's life in the style of ""his life, his work"" in particular his careers as a journalist, politician, collector (great interest for Japan and Greece antique), artist and writer. A little hagiographic in ignoring its gray areas (Panama affair, strike breaker in violence and repression of social struggles, quarrels with Jules Ferry, Gambetta or Jaur√®s, incarceration of his wife for adultery then expulsion as a foreigner convicted of an offense of common law to the United States, with a third class ticket, and obtaining so that she loses custody of her children and French nationality...) but it is the law of the genre in this type of museum.",9 months ago,2024-12-28 16:13:18.453346,5.0,Benoit Dieu-Hunin,372,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107998399057172312345/reviews?hl=en
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxd0tmTW5BRRAB,"Very nice visit! A warm and efficient welcome, an attractive synthetic, multimedia exhibition gallery upstairs and on the garden level, the heritage apartment in very good condition! All this around a key character in our history, who covered all the major subjects, colonization, secularism, public order, technical progress and social transformation, the arts, etc. We know Clemenceau's words, implacable, sharp, chiseled, to the point that the man appears austere and intimidating. The place recalls all of this but also reveals the sensitivity of the hidden man, his taste for Japan, the garden, reading. He had enemies but he was able to attract excellent friends and behave with infinite loyalty himself. We owe him a lot in preserving the work of Claude Monet for example.
