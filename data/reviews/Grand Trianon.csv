ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuc2NXN2JREAE,"Visiting the Grand Trianon was a delightful experience that added a touch of elegance to my trip to Versailles. Nestled within the expansive grounds of the Palace of Versailles, this stunning pink marble pavilion offers a serene contrast to the opulence of the main palace.  Upon arrival, the architectural beauty of the Grand Trianon is immediately striking. The blend of classical and baroque styles creates a charming and intimate atmosphere. The gardens surrounding the pavilion are meticulously maintained, filled with vibrant flowers and lush greenery, perfect for a leisurely stroll.  Inside, the rooms are beautifully decorated, showcasing exquisite furniture and artworks that reflect the lifestyle of French royalty. I particularly enjoyed the gallery and the views of the gardens from the large windows, which made for some lovely photo opportunities.  Exploring the Grand Trianon felt like stepping back in time. The quieter, more personal setting allowed me to appreciate the history and the tranquil beauty of the area away from the larger crowds at the main palace.  Overall, my visit to the Grand Trianon was a highlight of my Versailles experience.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzNmI2dGdBRRAB,"As an accompaniment to the greater complex of the Palace of Versailles, it's a good side-visit (as your ticket may already include admission), but it should be visited as a side-trip and not as a primary focus. The buildings are significantly smaller than the nearby Palace and the grounds are not as well kept. During our visit, most of the fountains and water features were turned off (expected as it was November), and also growing quite a bit of algae from what appeared to be a long summer of little-to-no maintenance.
