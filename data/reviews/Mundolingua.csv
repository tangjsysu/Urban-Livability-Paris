ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYaWZLTnZRRRAB,"I stumbled upon this museum by chance. It has two floors and is truly remarkable. even though the computers are “outdated,” they brought back a sense of nostalgia for me. :D It’s an art to explain such an extensive topic like linguistics, and this museum did it perfectly. Both teachers and children will find something to enjoy here! It’s one of the few museums open on Mondays. It’s a shame that so few people know about this place!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtX3JxOUNBEAE,"The best (and the only?) museum I have been to that is dedicated to language with such professionalism and care. I visited with a 9 year old and we shared interest in the interactive activities, short videos, especially the ones about body gestures across cultures. I also liked the level of coverage of the various topics from phonology to writing systems, language families, codes, proverbs, and language register. There is also a nice collection of books, language related games (including a large scrabble carpet) and even the bathroom is decorated in a language inspired way. All the screens are adjustable to height and the information is translated into 6 languages. We thought we would spend only one hour there, but came back for more after lunch. One can easily spend 2-3 hours in Mundolingua, especially if you take the time to explore the topics that interest you deeply. It is a small museum - I hope it will get the opportunity to grow.

We spent two or three hours here and we could have easily spent another 2 hours as we didn't get round to everything (we stayed til closing time).

It's obvious that Mundolingua was born out of a love and fascination for language. The museum has two floors packed with all sorts of learning material about not just language itself, but also things like how animal communication, humour, language in relation to religion and how the brain relates to language. Even the toilets are packed with interested things to read! I spent over two hours there and I bet I would have stayed much longer if I hadn't arrived so close to closing time.
