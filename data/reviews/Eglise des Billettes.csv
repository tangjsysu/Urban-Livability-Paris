ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQOXJ1czJBRRAB,"A Protestant Lutheran chapel was built in the 13th century. An adjoining cloister was added in the 15th century when the church was rebuilt. After many modifications and reconstructions, the current church dates from the 18th century and was attached to the Lutheran cult at the beginning of the 19th century. The cloister, also modified and restored, is the only cloister preserved from the Middle Ages in Paris. These 2 places are only partially open: day and time. The Lutheran church is open Thursday and Sunday.
