ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqdjVfV3N3RRAB,"The Protestant Church of the Oratory of the Louvre is one of the most important Protestant church buildings in Paris. It is located near the Louvre and has a rich history dating back to the 17th century.  The Oratoire du Louvre, as it is known in French, was founded in 1611 by the Protestant priest Pierre Fosse. It originally functioned as a house of prayer, but over time it developed into a full church. The current building was constructed between 1621 and 1625.  A notable aspect of the Oratoire du Louvre is its architecture. It belongs to the period of French classicism and was designed by the well-known architect Jacques Lerouin. The style of the building is striking, with classic lines and decorative elements that reflect its era.  Today, the Protestant Church of the Oratory of the Louvre continues to function as a place of worship for the Protestant community of Paris, while also opening its doors for cultural events and exhibitions.",7 months ago,2024-12-27 20:26:56.419732,4.0,mlabrop,"1,215",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101430577295047934168/reviews?hl=en
