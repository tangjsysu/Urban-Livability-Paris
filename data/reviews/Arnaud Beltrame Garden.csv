ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUZ00tYWdRRRAB,"It’s quite unique parc/ jardin than any other parc.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMaDVlckxREAE,"It is more of a wooded area than a garden, but any patch of greenery is welcome. In 1683, the construction of the Minimes convent was completed here, which was closed in 1790. It was in 1823 that the old buildings of the convent, then national property acquired by the Municipality of Paris, were transformed into a gendarmerie known as the “Minimes Barracks”. In 2019, the function of this island changes. The buildings are restructured to accommodate social housing and a nursery. The interior courtyard is open and planted with plants. It partly becomes a public garden and two spaces at the ends are made available to residents. Planters are installed along the edges and trees are planted in the center in the spirit of the garden of the old cloister.",5 months ago,2024-12-28 16:51:26.919731,3.0,Laurent Padou,850,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102878442016850755868/reviews?hl=en-GB

There are certainly trees, but its surface is mainly paved, with little grass and shrubs; everything is orderly and symmetrical.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1Z09LaUF3EAE,"We pinch ourselves when discovering that this courtyard can be described as a “garden”. It is not bad, but it refers to a very 20th century conception where the idea of ​​climate change struggled to be recognized.
