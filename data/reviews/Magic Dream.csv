ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzMUplekRREAE,"Not serious, I call to find out if they have a large size close up carpet from the ttc brand left, they tell me yes. On the site it is in stock and in 2 colors, I travel, drive an hour and 15 minutes there and as much on the way back for nothing. When I arrive there as if by a miracle they have sold all their stock of all the colors but on their site, you can go and see it is still miraculously in stock!!!!  It's what we call ""magic"" and a big waste of time. On the other hand, they will never see me again and will give them free publicity. So I'm going to order it from the little magician where we receive it in 48 hours by colissimo and without any problem.  Hello, I have just read your response which is misleading if not dishonest but hardly surprises me and reassures me in my reasoning. First of all, in no case did I insult or molest your partner, but indeed I was angry and left without saying anything, without any goodbye or thanks. As a reminder, I called you on Saturday at 5:16 p.m. from my cell phone while you closed at 6:30 p.m. and arrived at your home almost at opening Tuesday, knowing that you are closed on Sunday and Monday. I would like to believe you that in an hour and thirty minutes, a crowd of magicians rushed into your establishment and robbed you of your large close up excellence carpets, but you won't make anyone believe it. I see that you are reactive when you are unhappy with a review but much less so in updating your website, even today you advertise your large size rugs in stock, which is also in two colors. Updating your site will surely prevent people like me from wasting hours in Paris traffic jams. It is not difficult as you say so well, to improve better service, just be sincere and tell the truth about your stock, perhaps he thought he had some and did not check, that I can imagine it. If you want proof, the cell phone remembers phone call times and it was 5:16 p.m. on Saturday. Send me a phone number and I will send you a screen shot if you wish to prove it to you.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaMmNib3RRRRAB,"Really disappointed. I order the Tetracube for €170!  3 weeks later the cube is stuck and becomes unusable. A joint in the center has been released. I am told that the poor assembly of the ""flap"" is surely the cause or incorrect use!!!! No written documentation or explanation on mounting the flaps... a video with NO commentary on the subject. Deal with that. I am told that they made a commercial gesture by changing the cube for me. I think we are more on the European law of the 2 year legal guarantee! I receive the cube in exchange.  A few manipulations from one hand to the other, nothing more and after 15 days a defect appears again on the second cube. This time the adhesive twists.... There I am told that with my use and even if it falls on the ground cannot achieve this result.... But they are unable to tell me why this defect happens!!!! The cube is obviously not the cause..... I am certainly using it incorrectly...  But for professionals it is not professional not to be able to explain, except to say “misuse”  In any case there is a real quality problem with this product... or recommendations to be expected. I ask for a refund or credit... and I even offer a credit by returning the cube and thus offer to buy on the site for the amount of the credit. I am returning the cube because I do not want to work with a product that seems to have so many defects (2 in 2 months). And so they can investigate the faulty cube for improvement.  To date, no refund, no credit, nor even an echo indicating that they had understood the source of the problem.  But we are collecting orders... Very good relationship before placing orders, but less motivated afterwards!  By talking by telephone with the inventor of the Tetracube, we learn a lot and understand the current situation better...  I go my way Damage.  Nota Bene: The selling price set by the inventor was $100 Canadian (~€70).
