ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYa2R6dnVRRRAB,"It's a museum with rotating exhibits.  Make sure it's the exhibit you're interested in seeing.  I didn't love what I saw, which is not the norm for me when it comes to  a museum in Paris.  Some of the stuff I saw was interesting, but most of it was pretentious.  The sticks on the floor have to be explained to you before they ignite any sort of interest.  I like my art to hit me first, on a visceral level w/ o any explanation of what I'm supposed to think or feel.  Any explanation can enhance or deepen my connection to the art, but it shouldn't be necessary for me to appreciate a piece of art.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzLThEajN3RRAB,"Never a fan of modern art myself, I came here mainly for the heritage building and perhaps checking the billionaire's private art collection. There is none of that. Instead, there are just rooms showing the hilariously pretentious and pointless work by arte povera artists. What a waste of space. The building is beautifully renovated. A shame about what's inside. What's absurd is I still had to wait 30+ minutes with an online reservation. When I finally got inside, it's not even that crowded. Only worth it if you can get in for free.

The exhibition was also great with all the contemporary and modern art masters you would expect to see in a museum of this caliber. Very well curated too.  5 huge starts.  Edit : went back during the Olympics and the quality of the exhibition kept being superlative!

Only 1% was true art. I tried hard to understand what I was looking at but it was impossible. I kept thinking that somebody is having a joke, laughing at me.
