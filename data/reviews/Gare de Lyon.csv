ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIMnVxbEtREAE,"I had to leave from this train station to get to Barcelona-Sants and it was so easy to get to Gare de Lyon from the train station in Saint-Denis. It's a very busy station but it was clean and there was a lot of staff to help passengers. The staff members were lovely and gave good  advice and directions. It was my first time using the high speed train service in Paris so they were able to explain the process. The platform number is only confirmed approx. 20 minutes before the departure time and you'll need to use your ticket QR code to scan to pass through the gate at the platform. I bought my ticket via eurail. Note that your Global Pass is scanned on the train by a train conductor not at the gate. Lots of seating is around the train station and not sure about the bathroom situation as I didn't use it while I was there but I don't think the public bathroom is free of charge. There are lots of eateries and little shops/kiosks to purchase food, snacks and beverages to take on your journey with you. I didn't see a place to buy postcards though. There were a few beggars around the station but just politely refuse if you don't have euros to give them. In general, July is a busy time of year because of the season and even more so in my case as I was in Paris for the Olympics. Great location and I really loved the Olympic spirit that the station displayed.",5 months ago,2025-02-09 14:51:59.140509,4.0,Rachel Spencer,484,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107597809479161020643/reviews?hl=en-US

Hall 1 is the historic hall of the station, dominated by the emblematic restaurant Le Train Bleu, a true Parisian institution that is worth a visit on its own. Its large forecourt is enlivened in summer by terraces and pop-up stores. Hall 2, modern and bright, welcomes mainline travellers and offers a wide range of restaurants.
