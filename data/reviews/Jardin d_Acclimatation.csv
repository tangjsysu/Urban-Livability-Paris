ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2OGZpRFdREAE,4.5 stars......The kids had a blast at my wallets expenses. We had a blast and it was less than our trip to Disney. 27€ for all four of us to enter. Slightly disappointed that the moveable dinos were unplugged but understanding because of the rain. 42€ each for unlimited rides and they did most definitely 42€ worth of rides. The coffee and popcorn were affordable and so delicious. The café was a perfect ending to our time here and for all four of us to have lunch was about 40€. All in all it was a great time despite the rain and the park is beautiful. The 7 different children's parks were a perfect way to start our day and then we worked our way to all the rides. Both my children are 120cm or taller and it was perfect for all the rides.,6 days ago,2024-12-27 19:26:55.158828,4.0,tessa novack,118,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107876399064182551701/reviews?hl=en-GB

Easily walkable, small queues, interesting festivals throughout the year: Holi, Dia de los muertos, Chinese New Year etc with shows, food trucks and parades.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4blBPNllBEAE,"We had such a beautiful day here as a family, there was honestly so much to do.  First of all, there are multiple ticket options available for entry into the park. We went for the ""park access only"" option which gives you access to the grounds but not to the attractions. This was €7 per person which I thought was reasonable, and also gives you the option of buying ""tickets d'attraction"" separately once you're inside. This made the most sense for us as we didn't want to go on all the rides but more so just enjoy the atmosphere and generally explore.  The grounds are vast with plenty to see and do with kids. Picnic, ice cream, rides, trampolines, water fountains, restaurants etc. Ideal for a Saturday with the kids.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSeHZmRlVBEAE,"It was our kids first trip to Paris, and we REALLY did not want to take them to an amusement park - we have those in America, let's focus on some uniquely Parisian experiences. But after a couple days of difficulty and disappointment due to strikes and protests, we gave in, and we're SO glad we did. It was a weekday morning in March, so we basically had the park to ourselves. In America you would expect in that situation that they would be half-staff or less, and many rides wouldn't be open - not so here, everything was up and running (except, sadly, the Dragon Coaster, but I think that was a construction issue). We were so pleased with how stylish, clean and charming everything was. The mechanical ponies gallop though real topiary arches, the boats sail through an old-style Norman farm (with goats!), the modern rides are painted to look more vintage, the sprawling gardens and lawns are so picturesque... it was a wonderful experience for everyone. They've taken a place with a rather disturbing history and turned it into a joyful playground. Being there with no crowds certainly helped, and we were able to see and do everything we wanted in a few hours, so that we still had time for other activities later. For tourist families with young kids, this is certainly a great way to please them for a bit, while still having a (relatively) unique and enjoyable French experience.",a year ago,2024-12-27 19:26:59.444350,5.0,David Wilcox,27,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114869520362734235441/reviews?hl=en

On one hand it's nice that you can visit the park for free (tip) if you get tickets to the fondation Luis Vuitton, but know that pretty much all the attractions are payed, so you have to buy an additional ticket. There is a family ticket for €135 in the high season, which is very likely to be much cheaper than buying separate tickets for the rides. Also, the family ticket was cheaper in the park itself than online, which was strange. Staff was very friendly, which is actually amazing considering the noise around them all day.
