ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKNHVyRVdnEAE,"This pretty little square, inaugurated in 1933, (whose name was changed in 2008), is hidden below and at the end of a dead end street. It continues to be called Square R√©camier for local residents, because it is located on the grounds of a former destroyed convent, where Juliette R√©camier ended her days, hence the name of the impasse! Slightly hilly, it does not lack charm, with all the vegetation, including a large weeping beech. Numerous benches, nooks and crannies invite you to relax and calm! Just a small regret: the fountain stopped which supplied 2 fitted pools, now empty. But that doesn't take anything away from the romanticism of this square nestled in the shadow of beautiful buildings.",a year ago,2025-02-09 14:59:38.360852,5.0,Fran√ßoise,369,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108799099049503589097/reviews?hl=en-US

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxMHVlQVF3EAE,"Very cute little square: it has a lot of advantages. Its tranquility because it is at the bottom of a dead end, it is shaded and there are enough benches, it is clean and it has a playground. There is a slight drop in height to enter but as there is an access ramp, it is not an obstacle. There are very small paths under the shrubs, they allow children to play hide and seek. It is a square where it is easy to supervise children and where you can rest, chat or read a book.
