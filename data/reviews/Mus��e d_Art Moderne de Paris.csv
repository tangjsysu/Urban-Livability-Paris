The collection is incredibly diverse, ranging from abstract paintings to enigmatic sculptures and even light fixtures!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNydmV5UDVRRRAB,"Very educative exhibitions. Three exhibits when I visited: the permanent, Jean Hélion and an exhibition about Arabic influence in Paris from 1900 called « Presence arabe ».  The two non permanent exhibitions are so great and so differently exposed. Both put in an amazing and fair perspective the different shapes of art.  For Jean hélion exhibition, the chronological progress makes clear his way from abstract to near realism through figurative and it really highlights the diversity of his perspectives and evolutions. I am impressed .  The « presence arabe » exhibition mixed so many painters that it is mainly a true discovery of artists and styles; though the fil rouge is the colonialism and its disaster.

Though the Louvre offers its own splendor and the Musee d’Orsay is a treasure trove of some of my favorite impressionist artists, and while the beautiful and tranquil Marmoset Museum permits quiet and studied viewing of the works of Claude Monet, in particular, it was the Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris that awakened in me a sense of the purpose of Art, and left me questioning why other museums of modern art don’t do a better job with curating and presenting the work of contemporary artists. This museum was like a sanctuary, more than any other that I visited in the city. Its use of light and space is exceptional, propelling the viewer to one enlightened exhibit after another, and inviting one to stop and ponder the meaning of the work at hand.  All in all this is a space I would choose to visit over and over, more than any of the other art museums I have visited in the city.

The three-storey mural by Raoul Dufy celebrating the history of electricity (probably 90% of visitors don't catch this theme) is wonderful. Sit down on the stools and set a spell to rake it all in. The dance murals by Matisse, that were originally intended for the Barnes House in Philadelphia are very interesting. Matisse errored in the measurements hence he create two sets of these.  The permanent collection,  now with the addition of the donation by the Josef and Anni Albers family, is strong in the 1910 to 1940 period.

I particularly enjoyed the art from between the wars and appreciated seeing that museum had acquired several new pieces that I did like since the last time I visited.  I spent about two hours there and had lunch in their restaurant.
