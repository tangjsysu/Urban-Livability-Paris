ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2NXRHN0dnEAE,"The Orangerie is too easily overlooked by visitors to Paris who are keen to 'do' the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, and other major attractions, which is a great shame, because this unassuming building houses some of the art world's great masterpieces. Even if you only go to see the eight monumental waterlily paintings by Monet, the visit will be more than worth it. However, before viewing the Monet paintings, I recommended heading downstairs to see the fantastic collection or works that include Picasso, Manet, Matisse and other great luminaries of art.",a week ago,2024-12-28 15:46:22.292668,5.0,Jim Lesses,67,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108961166922768184933/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzak5HUjZ3RRAB,"We visited the Mus√©e de l'Orangerie during a night opening on November 1st and feel like we couldn't have been luckier with that. Monet's vision for those of us wanting to see his Nymph√©as was one of tranquility and for there to be room to feel at peace. I would think this feeling is hard to come by during the usually busy and popular opening hours. While the museum tries people to stay more or less quiet in those two halls, a lot of people don't seem to get it. I have been looking for feelings of peace and tranquility for a very long time now, struggling with intense anxiety, I felt so well while sitting there. For the first time in a very long time I could just 'be', I could simply exist and enjoy just doing that. This night opening meant the world to me!

The museum's highlight is the Water Lilies murals by Claude Monet, displayed in specially designed oval-shaped rooms. The museum showcases a stunning collection of artwork by celebrated artists including Renoir, C√©zanne, and Picasso. However, the museum's popularity has led to overcrowding and challenges in maintaining the peaceful atmosphere it aims to provide. One downside being that it is challenging to find a quiet spot to mindfully observe the Water Lilies, which is (was) the main purpose of the (our) visit.

While it was amazing to see this extraordinary body of work by Monet, it was somewhat difficult to contemplate upon and enjoy the paintings because of the following factors. One is that the paintings are so big that the whole picture could not be grasped without the reflections from the illuminating light and (2) very high number of the visitors created some chaotic environment and atmosphere, contrasting with the calm and peaceful themes and intent of the paintings. Improvements in these regards would, I think, make visitors (and perhaps Monet himself) happier as the intent of displaying is for people to appreciate the artist and the paintings.
