ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeXZTVDFnRRAB,"It is a very pretty fountain located in the promenade of the Allée du Séminaire-Jean-Jacques-Olier which runs along the rue Bonaparte in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, not far from the Place Saint-Sulpice.  The Fountain of Peace (or Fountain of Peace and Arts) is a fountain in a neo-classical style, very close to the Fountain of Mars which dates from the same period.  A square massif topped with triangular pediments is placed in the center of a square basin.  Take the time to walk around the different faces of this fountain, you will see the magnificent details.  Indeed, the four faces are decorated with allegorical bas-reliefs by the sculptor Jean-Joseph Espercieux representing Agriculture, Commerce, Science and the Arts and Peace.  On two opposite sides, there is a basin in the shape of a clam shell which collects water coming from an orifice before it flows into the general basin surrounding the fountain.  It was renovated in 2019 and 2020 and is worth a little detour",2 years ago,2025-01-24 11:41:09.444918,5.0,Becca,314,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109418147558605579147/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTOHZhUWVBEAE,"The Fontaine de la Paix (or Fontaine de la Paix et des Arts) is a fountain located in the promenade of the Allée du Séminaire-Jean-Jacques-Olier which runs along the rue Bonaparte in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, not far from the Place Saint-Sulpice. This fountain is one of the 15 fountains that were to be put into service in Paris after the completion of the Ourcq canal. The architect Destournelles had designed it to be built on the Place du Chatelet at the request of Napoleon I to commemorate the Peace Treaty of Amiens, but in 1807, it was decided to build it on the outskirts of the Place Saint-Sulpice . It only remained there until 1824, the year when it was relegated to the Saint-Germain market, the imposing Saint-Sulpice fountain having to occupy the center of the square. In 1935, it was moved again to occupy its current location, in the Allée du Séminaire, an open, wooded garden which slopes down to the rue de Vaugirard on the odd side of rue Bonaparte. This alley had just been created by the destruction of the buildings of the Community of Daughters of Christian Instruction. It is a fountain in a neoclassical style, very close to the Fountain of Mars which dates from the same period. A square massif topped with triangular pediments is placed in the center of a square basin. The four faces are decorated with allegorical bas-reliefs by the sculptor Jean-Joseph Espercieux which represent Agriculture, Commerce, Science and the Arts and Peace.
