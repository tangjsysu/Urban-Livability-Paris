ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMaDRfUDZRRRAB,"Magnificent square with trees and flowers, very well maintained. Protected from noise, it is ideal for a break. It includes a small play area for children. Lines of trees, geometric flowerbeds surrounded by paths and stone benches characterize this garden. Added to these charms is the view of the facade of the Grand Veneur mansion. This historic monument built in the 17th century was acquired and transformed in 1734 by Vincent Hennequin, Marquis d'Ecquevilly, captain general of the king's hunting expedition - in other words of his hunting crew - at the origin of the exterior decorations celebrating his activity. The name of the square associates Grand Veneur with Saint-Gilles, named after the neighboring street of the same name.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6NHFmUDl3RRAB,"This magnificent square (like all the others) is a poor reflection of the Parisian microcosm: it well sums up the “no” of knowing how to live together of the neighboring owner who wants peace, of the mother of the family who wants space, the dog owner who wants greenery, the onlooker who can pee in peace (or more) against the wall, the young people who come to squat and smoke the lawn, and the one who comes to read in peace. Neighbors managed to ban access to the dogs by tirelessly calling the police. The city installed children's games to endorse the ban. Sound games have been installed so they continue to call the police for the shrill sounds.
