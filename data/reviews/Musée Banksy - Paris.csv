If you choose between exposition and hotel, I’d definitely recommend the first. The art is stunning and there aren’t many people.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGc19PS0pnEAE,"My recent visit to the Banksy Museum in Paris was undeniably a memorable and enjoyable experience. As a fan of street art and Banksy's unique style, I was thrilled to explore the museum's collection, which did not disappoint.  The museum, while small in size, manages to pack a punch with its curated selection of Banksy's artworks. The pieces on display are not only thought-provoking but also a testament to Banksy's wit and creativity. The intimate atmosphere of the museum allowed me to get up close and personal with the art, enhancing my overall experience.  One thing to note is the option to purchase a combo ticket, which includes a visit to the museum and a stay at the associated hotel. However, I would advise against opting for this combo ticket. The hotel visit, unfortunately, did not match the same level of excitement and intrigue as the museum itself.",a year ago,2025-03-15 22:30:16.796628,4.0,Lanie Fu,67,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115080662417480049684/reviews?hl=en-US

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEMnR2NlV3EAE,"A good option for a rainy afternoon if you have a teen to entertain. The exhibition is not huge, but large enough that you get a good idea of Banksy's work and ""message"".  A lot of his work, however, does not translate well into a gallery space, as of course a good part of Banksy's power and excitement results from his art popping up in unexpected places -  a rebellious, because illegal, gesture. However ""alternative"" the gallery's design might be, this aspect is completely neutralised here.  His art has long occupied that grey area between anti-establishment protest and clever self marketing. Fittingly, the whole gallery feels like a funnel leading you to the shop, which you can't bypass on your way out, as in most museums nowadays, to be fair. All in all, not an unpleasant experience, although not cheap and a little too mercantile for my taste.",11 months ago,2025-03-15 22:30:21.168962,4.0,Guillaume Destot,16,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114295805374676355924/reviews?hl=en
