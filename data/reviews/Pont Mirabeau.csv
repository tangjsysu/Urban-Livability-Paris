ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2czgzQ2dBRRAB,This is one lovely bridge. Period. On one side you can admire the mini statute of liberty and the eiffel tower and on the other a hot air balloon on top of the river seine. There are benches on both sides. Don't forget to checkout the 4 statues that adorn the feet of the bridge.,3 years ago,2025-01-24 13:39:47.739253,5.0,Andrew Yip,224,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115877903290481976975/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNXVTTjZnRRAB,"At the heart of Paris lies a hidden gem that truly captures the essence of the City of Light. The Pont Mirabeau, a stunning bridge over the Seine, is a must-see for anyone visiting the city.  As soon as you step onto the bridge, you're surrounded by breathtaking views of the Seine and the surrounding Parisian architecture. The ambiance is serene and tranquil, perfect for a peaceful stroll or a romantic evening walk. The service is non-existent, but that's okay because the beauty of the bridge speaks for itself.  The bridge itself is a masterpiece, featuring intricate designs and impressive engineering. What sets it apart from other bridges in Paris is its historical significance as it was the inspiration for one of Guillaume Apollinaire's most famous poems. This adds a unique layer of depth to the experience, making it truly special.  I cannot think of any criticisms for this place as it is simply stunning in every way. However, if I had to suggest one improvement, it would be to add more lighting to the bridge at night to enhance the views even further.  I am grateful for the opportunity to experience the Pont Mirabeau and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Paris. This place left an impression on me that will last a lifetime, and I am likely to return again and again.",a year ago,2025-01-24 13:39:47.742253,5.0,Reda Haddou,515,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114553008799835481583/reviews?hl=en-GB
