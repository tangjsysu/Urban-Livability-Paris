ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNVXzlxSmN3EAE,"The banks of the Seine (Berges de Seine) are a must-visit walk in Paris, where you can appreciate the evening life of the city. When everyone leaves work, on a summer and spring afternoon (in winter the cold keeps you away), you can see a lot of Parisians and tourists walking and doing recreational activities. But the majority organize to have a snack and drink (especially the latter) in the company of friends and family. The truth is that it is a spectacle that cannot be appreciated by going in winter, Paris is better in spring, summer and autumn. From experience, my first trip was in a harsh winter, I had a great time, but when I went in July (first week) the heat was not so terrible and you can appreciate all the beauty of its gardens and the mythical Seine.",5 years ago,2025-01-24 13:18:19.981680,5.0,Andres Luciano Nicolas Martinuzzi,729,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113222051829771120297/reviews?hl=en
