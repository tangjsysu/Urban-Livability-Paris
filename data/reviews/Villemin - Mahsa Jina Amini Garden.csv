I wast 5000 euros in a small apartment above a pizza place with dust everywhere, every single time in sever pain, only to be talked down to when crying. My dentist today is telling me to sew him for not answering and giving me the ""passport"" of my teeth. Do not go,  you will just be wasting money for him to cause you great, excruciatierng pain. The times I have come out of that ""apartment"" and had to go back home by metro and RER, on hour and half ride- crying on the floor of the metro in pain. Only to start the entire process again today and have to pay again. Also he told me he put implants but they are in fact not as my new dentist has told me...
