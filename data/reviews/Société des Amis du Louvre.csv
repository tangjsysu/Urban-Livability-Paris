ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1a2NITUd3EAE,"Very weird position. Note that the society is located in the museum, and you theoretically cannot go in if you haven't got the card, which can be obtained on site so it is really catch 22. You better order the card online and carry it when going there.  If you really don't have the time or you faced difficulties of receiving the card by post, try to communicate with the staff outside Richelieu's Gate.  Little tips that few people noticed: if you are under 26, the membership which lasts for a year, is actually cheaper than ordering one ticket online, and the same price as buying one ticket on site.  The staffs are very friendly. The site is also very quiet and comfortable.",a year ago,2025-01-24 12:46:25.100973,4.0,Áéã‰ºüËæ∞,14,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100316407983902983792/reviews?hl=en-GB
