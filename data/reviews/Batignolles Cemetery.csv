ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvZ05fakR3EAE,"Staff could not be more unpleasant.  I was forbidden to place a candle, citing a so-called prohibition written in the regulations. However, nothing in the regulation mentions such a ban. I contacted Paris City Hall on Twitter, they confirmed to me that no such ban exists - obviously, we are in a cemetery! On the other hand, littering the cemetery *is* a real ban - yet the staff members did not hesitate to crush my candle, leaving wax everywhere. The hospital that doesn't care about charity!  In addition to this, I always feel watched there, I have the impression of being seen like a UFO when I set foot there. Furthermore, the cemetery is not necessarily pleasant in itself - broken slabs, earth everywhere, the benches are always dirty, without even mentioning the part under the ring road, always dirty too.  If it wasn't for Paul Verlaine, the Batignolles cemetery, I wouldn't take the trouble to come there regularly.",5 years ago,2024-12-27 20:01:40.526435,1.0,Nephelith Rosfield,58,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117740518104384385088/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3bXVEcFFnEAE,"So it may seem strange, but Parisians like to walk in cemeteries... Well at the same time with cemeteries covering 11 hectares of land and more than 800 trees to admire, we can understand.  In addition, several personalities are buried here, such as Paul Verlaine and Andr√© Breton and certain mausoleums and tombs are true feats of sculpture. It would be a shame to miss it, we might as well stay weird üòà.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBaUoybjVnRRAB,"Small disappointment for this Batignolles cemetery. It looked huge on my map, in practice it's not that big.  Of the promised '11 hectares of green space', I mainly saw a lost opportunity: no flowerbeds or very few, a few trees and that's it. However, there would have been plenty to do in terms of layout. The paths are not very well maintained (broken bitumen, very ugly). At the west end of the cemetery, cars pass directly on a bridge over the graves.  Finally, this cemetery still has some tombs of famous people (Paul Verlaine, Gaston Calmette, Andr√© Breton, etc.) but nothing is highlighted on site! Zero signs, no indications on the map, nothing at all, so I couldn't find any interesting tombs.  My advice: look at Wikipedia and the Paris City Hall page before going there, and download the super well-made maps with directions to find the points of interest as well as their descriptions.  Finally, last thing, with the work in progress to extend line 14, access is not easy... and the area is very disreputable.
