I gave it 5 stars thanks to them! Because I would have liked to remove at least 1 or 2 stars compared to the price of entry and all the snacks I still find the prices a little high especially when you come with 3/4 children the bill quickly becomes dirty So maybe review the prices As for the games, they are great, nothing to say, the children had a blast but it's a shame that the parents can't play a little game with their children in the big pirate ship. We are also big children üòäü§£ we would like it when there are not many children of course we could allow it when there are less crowds.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2eDVfZE5REAE,"Extremely disappointed... Arriving for a bowling game 1h45 before closing, we were informed that we could only play one and only one game, being 3 and 4 per lane, that is.... Realizing that our game ends and there is more than an hour before closing we kindly ask if it is possible to restart one on the track of three people, negative answer. By the time our part on the second track finished, so 10 or 15 minutes, the reception had let around ten people pass through. Obviously no justification for the fact that they can return and that we cannot play again. Between the flexible closure, not for us however and the fact that we are clearly paying for ourselves, I do not recommend.
