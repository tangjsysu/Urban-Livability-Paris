ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvdGJhS3d3RRAB,"St. Louis (Église Saint-Louis-en-l'Île) is an early 18th-century church on the island in the middle of the Seine River. It features both Baroque and Classical architecture and is open from 9.30-1pm and 2-7.30pm (Mon-Sat) and 9-1pm and 2-7pm (Sun).  The exterior is very simple, doesn't stand out from other buildings along Rue Saint-Louis with the exception of the bell tower with a hanging clock helps give away the presence of a church.  Once inside, a much larger than anticipated interior presents itself. The nave includes columns and ceiling with nice gilding and stucco ornamentation. Stained-glass windows behind an attractive main altar and altarpiece make for nice sightseeing.  The aisles and area behind the main altar include smaller chapels with impressive frescos. However, these areas receive much less natural light so are more difficult to view properly. Historic artworks by Fra Angelico, Coypel and Carle Van Loo can be viewed within these chapels as well.  Overall, we like Église Saint-Louis-en-l'Île. It is a nice church with a few really nice artworks to see. If you are planning to be on the island or if you simply like visiting historic churches, this is a good place to include in your sightseeing itinerary.",5 years ago,2025-02-09 15:23:03.770069,4.0,Brad,"5,639",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en-US
