ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2ajdTUGh3RRAB,"A very lovely corner for those who love sculpture and the relationship between art and space. Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi was a Romanian sculptor who was trained at Bucharest school of fine arts. He did some amazing work and there are many pieces you can admire in Paris. This is not the original studio but a remake by the architect Renzo Piano who did an amazing job capturing the essence of a private cozy space where Br√¢ncu»ôi created such amazing art. The lighting is lovely and so soft, giving the impression of smoothness to the rough edges and is very similar to the original studio. You can also admire his original tools and photos of his old studios. I cannot recommend this enough, it's is a very special space, a hidden gem in the middle of Paris.",3 years ago,2025-03-15 22:46:11.513223,5.0,Daniela Telehuz,336,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111862047223684267277/reviews?hl=en-US
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoak82dVd3EAE,"A free museum! And for the better, as it only has a big centered exposition of all of Br√¢ncu≈üi's artwork. There's a historic of how he came to Paris and the struggles he had to suffer through before he was able to afford his own workshops.  The information is in both french and english, but it was presented very theoretical. Didn't feel like a story was being told. There was not much focus on the great sculptures inside, and there was no mention of anything he did in Romania, prior to coming to Paris.  This isn't his actual workshop, and it discloses it early on. The artwork used to be in open air.  It's a trip worth taking, considering it's free.",2 years ago,2025-03-15 22:46:11.514247,5.0,Lucian Marin,499,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115456628886222260247/reviews?hl=en-US

There are numerous sculptures on display including several renditions of his famous 'Bird In Space' sculpture, amongst numerous other provocative an intriguing works to view and enjoy.  There was also an interesting Mihal Olos exhibition being held at the time of our visit. We enjoyed the artworks being displayed, finding them to complement the Brancusi works nicely.
