ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzc3BhYnJ3RRAB,"I had a family dinner of 4 with one kid last evening. We ordered 1. Cheese naan bombs - these were tiny ones served in 6 had burst of flavour and is definitely a must try. It could hv been bigger in size. 2. Dimsums - It's a loot in this category because this comes with 4 dimsums though the taste was up it's overly priced compared to other places known for dimsums. I would rather recommend to try their Vietnamese roll 3. Nawabi pizza - The dough was super soft and thin loaded with toppings but lacked the depth in flavour. We had to manually season it loads to satisfy our palate. 4. Malai broccoli - This was good and had a slight smokish flavour infused in the malai. We were served with 4 large florets in a plate. 5. Lotus stem - it was not served hot , as the crisps were Little hard. But had good flavour. 6. Subz biryani - it was light and really good in flavour, would highly recommend to end your meal with this savoury.  Overall though the food was good, ambience was great. I would rather 3 as it's overly priced compared to its peers offering the similar ones.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzLVp5VUtBEAE,"We came here looking at the reviews and must say, the menu card spread does look pretty interesting.  Alas, the food spread - as fancy as they sound - have a sizable lot to do as far as the taste itself and the portion sizes go.  The Kokum-based mocktail was supremely oversweet. They offered to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it. And ‚Äúfix‚Äù they did with some masala floating in this time with a little less ice. Unfortunately, it was pretty much the same sweetness levels. Credits though for taking it off the bill.  Next came the dimsums - which the staff member recommended himself. While the turnaround was quick, the portion sizes for that price certainly takes you by surprise - ‚Çπ425 for 4 piddly steamed veggie balls? Guess it is about time these ‚Äúnice‚Äù places gave its patrons some value (at least increase the size of the dimsums yo!).  The Sicilian pizza was average at best. Trust me, we‚Äôve all had better pizzas somewhere before. But an A for the turnaround again.  The highlight was their ‚Äúsignature‚Äù Mysore Pak cheesecake. I mean it is just a teeny cheesecake with very little leftover Mysore Pak crumbles strewn over it (not to forget the berry coul√©e designs on the plate, to make it appear lux and trending).  Attaching a pic for the reasonable readers amongst you to decide for yourself - am I making it up or some folks really need to do some reflecting? Apologies - we were 1/4th way through when it struck us what we were putting up with. üôÑ  Must say though, the staff are nice and eager to serve.

The food order was taken promptly by repeating each dish we ordered.  However, they took a very very long time to make a simple Caesar salad and even after asking twice they didn't care for it. No apologies or any sort of is given. When we asked them to cancel, they didn't have any regrets about it.  As for the starters, the lotus stem, soups, sushi & the nachos were good. Dimsum was very creamy.  Special mention to the hummus platter which most of us liked.  We also ordered a few drinks in which mine was too lemony. Virgin pina colada is excellent.  As for the main course we didn't order much but whatever we ordered was good. The thai curry was more creamy and less spicy. The risotto & lasagne was good but there were no condiments provided. The server didn't have any knowledge on those. When asked he simply said it's all extra charge.  The service is too bad. Except for the girl who served us water often without asking, the rest of them were just poor. One has refused to serve when asked. He doesn't know how to talk to your guests.  ""Special thanks to the girl"". The extra 1 star is for that girl.  Suggestion to the service team. Please learn a few magic words like sorry, thank you, etc. You need this to get more crowds on weekends. But the order taker came to us in the end & asked collectively on how the food & service was. I suggest, that it should be done often when we are eating. Not definitely after we pay the bill.  I'm from Chennai & this would be my first & last visit to this restaurant.  Overall it's just a below average restaurant.",6 months ago,2025-01-24 13:57:19.555296,2.0,Sai Prasath,152,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116498511894138968903/reviews?hl=en

Good for lunch or dinner with family and friends.,2 months ago,2025-01-24 13:57:19.557296,5.0,Lavanya Ponnapoolu,29,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110653068962603571603/reviews?hl=en
ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuOVltS2lRRRAB,Visited for family lunch on 6/10/24 .. Lot of crowd .. Had reserved prior .. The best among the dishes ordered was the Farmhouse Pizza .. Soups were good ..Others ok .. Pasta was served like a Gourmet dish .. Big plate with small depression.. small quantity of Pasta .. similarly Vanilla ice cream and Passion Fruit Pannacota .. an overkill..White Garden signature chaat board was a disappointment..Mocktails were ok ..Hummus platter was a let down ..  Points for improvement.. 1. Decrease the ratio of Serving person to tables .. My person was running between tables .. 2. Please put photos of the dishes in the menu.. we can make better choices 3. Trial portions .. so that we can eat more of different dishes .. 4. More of Kannada speaking staff  Points for Accolades.. 1. Vegetarian Hotel 2. Great Pizza 3. Good Staff,3 months ago,2025-01-24 13:57:19.557296,4.0,Praveen Battepati,30,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103726744713340614178/reviews?hl=en
