ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNl8tZFpREAE,"Victor Noir was a French journalist. After he was shot and killed by Prince Pierre Bonaparte, a cousin of the French Emperor Napoleon III, Noir became a symbol of opposition to the imperial regime. His tomb has become a fertility symbol.  The sculpture has a very noticeable protuberance in Noir's trousers. This has made it one of the most popular memorials for women to visit in the famous cemetery. The myth says that placing a flower in the upturned top hat after kissing the statue on the lips and rubbing its genital area will enhance fertility, bring a blissful sex life, or, in some versions, a husband within the year. As a result of the legend, those particular components of the otherwise verdigris statue are rather well-worn and shiny, as are the tips of the boots.",2 years ago,2024-12-27 19:52:01.572516,4.0,Sam Srinivasan,679,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102407911207631727118/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYcThLUVp3EAE,"As I stand in front of Victor Noir's recumbent effigy at the Cimeti√®re du P√®re-Lachaise in Paris, my eye immediately falls on the detailed depiction of the young man. The statue shows him in a relaxed pose, with his shirt half open and a charming smile on his lips. It is a remarkable sculpture that captures both the grace and tragedy of his life.  Born in 1848, Victor Noir was a French journalist known for his radical views. He was a passionate advocate for social justice and vehemently criticized the political injustices of his time. As I reflect on his short but eventful life, I realize that Noir was not just a simple journalist, but a symbol of the fight for freedom and the voice of the oppressed.  His life took a dramatic turn when, in 1870, he became embroiled in a conflict with Prince Pierre Bonaparte, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte. Noir had sharply criticized the government and the political establishment in an article, which led to a fatal confrontation. He was shot in a duel with the prince when he was only 22 years old. This violent death posthumously made him a martyr figure of the republican movement.  As I stand in front of his effigial statue, it is interesting to see how he is remembered by society. The statue is not only a memorial to a tragic loss, but also a symbol of the fight for freedom of expression and social justice. Many visitors come here to commemorate him, and they often leave flowers or small messages that keep the meaning of his message alive in people's minds.  I also notice that the statue has some distinctive traditions around it - especially for women, who often kiss their lips on the statue to find happiness in love. These practices demonstrate how Victor Noir entered Parisian mythology not only as a journalist but also as a cultural symbol.  Here, in front of this fascinating and at the same time moving sculpture, I realize that Victor Noir's life and death are not only an individual fate, but also a part of the larger history of France. His legacy lives on, and his grave is a place of remembrance of the power of words and the unceasing fight for justice and freedom.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5OU56bTdBRRAB,"The anatomical realism of the recumbent figure has led superstitious people to touch it for years, causing oxidation of the patina and erosion of the bronze. Thus, in her 1935 work dedicated to Dalou, Henriette Caillaux already noted this degradation.  The parts particularly affected are the relief of the face, the bullet hole, the virile part and the shoes. Folklore has it that women in need of children touch the recumbent figure, or even ride on it, in order to be made fertile.
