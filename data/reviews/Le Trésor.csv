We hat 6/6 oysters the Bretagne were sublime. With shallot vinaigrette as I like them and exceptional baguette. Then the ris de veaux was perfection accompanied by the house Chablis. Topped it all off with the caramely crepe suzette and a snifter of chartreuse vert and I can say no more other than it was exceptional.

They let you scan a QR code so you can add songs to their playlist. This was a great touch to make the evening a little more personal and enjoyable.  We had a quick drink and some bites. The food was excellent. We tried the soup of the day, which was butternut squash, we also tried the bone marrow with toast. Both were delicious. We were lucky enough to visit on a Monday when they have Magician performing. He was amazing! Performed a few great card tricks. He was so kind to make a balloon animal for our son. Honestly some of the best card tricks I’ve seen and the real reason for this review. I hope this review helps some decide to eat here.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqZ2JmQzh3RRAB,"The steak was decent, priced at 30 euros. With a glass of wine and a dessert, the total came to around 50 euros. However, I didn't find it exceptional, especially considering the price. The biggest disappointment was the interior decor - an awkward mishmash of brick, stone, and papier-mâché that felt out of place in Paris.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4OXJyVXZ3RRAB,"Went to this restaurant tonight for dinner. Initial greeting was lovely and we got a good table (for 4). Out waiter was very friendly throughout the whole evening and willing to help. The wait for our food, after we had ordered, was a bit longer than desired. The food in general was very satisfactory, especially the meat dishes. Only dish which disappointed was the guacamole which was bland and lacked any sort if seasoning or flavor. The little pot of popcorn which you get when initially come into the restaurant and sit down was a nice little touch (especially as I was there with a child, so for her to eat a little something before the real food was perfect).

My daughter and I ate there tonight, and in our four countries of travel so far, this was by far the best meal. (The French onion soup and caprese salad were the best we’ve ever had.) The food was outstanding—but believe it or not, that is beside the point. On our way in, my purse clipped a dish for two—a couple’s entire meal—and knock it to the ground, shattering the platter and destroying their meal. I felt SO horrible. But the kind and attentive staff not only hustled to get a replacement meal ready for the couple—they would not let me pay, and more importantly, they kept reassuring me that they understand mistakes happen.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5aHNpLTF3RRAB,I ended up here by accident. I was headed to a place I know doesn’t take reservations so I didn’t make one. Maybe I should have checked they were open on Mondays. Anyway we needed a restaurant nearby to have dinner before heading to a music club. All that to say they were very kind to fit us in without a reservation especially when it turned out they were unbelievably busy. Not long after we were seated the place filled up. The staff was nice. The food had good flavor. However there were only 3 servers for the whole place and one of them was also the hostess and one of the others was the bartender. How they managed at all I don’t know but it did translate to very slow service and our meals had been sitting so long that they were no longer warm when we got them. And I liked the atmosphere.
