ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYbHFLdnZRRRAB,"This museum is located in painter Eugène Delacroix's last apartment; he moved to this location on December 28, 1857, and remained until his death on August 13, 1863. It is both his home and studio.  Rotating exhibits but the museum displays a lot of his work and even has one of his pallettes and some brushes. The garden in back is wonderful. Very quiet and restful. Chairs and benches are all around and it is a great spot for sitting and contemplating.  There is a wonderful huge fig tree that has figs in season. Probably not there in Delacroix's time but nice to imagine it was.  A great way to learn more about this important artist.",2 months ago,2024-12-27 21:54:47.922040,5.0,Robert Ballantyne,106,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118373161684685706533/reviews?hl=en-GB

Can be a little bit disappointing because it’s quite small(3 rooms, 1 atelier and small garden) and doesn’t have many masterpieces there. There are some sketches of paintings and his portraits only. And because it’s not big enough to accommodate many visitors, it maybe hard to reserve the ticket during tourist peak season. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend to give a visit.
