ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzME9UZ2xRRRAB,The Zoo is very beautiful and organised. The map(posted below) really helps along the complete route. It takes around 3-4 hours maximum to traverse along all the animals including having your lunch. There are two cafeterias to have lunch in.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3MTdyQWlRRRAB,"The zoo is very beautiful and well-maintained. The rare animals, especially the marine ones, are a delight to see. The zoo is well-indicated, and the animals seem happy and well-cared for. However, I noticed that the baboon monkeys seemed to be in need of more vegetation in their enclosure. I hope the zoo administration will consider addressing this issue. The Amazon corner of the zoo is particularly impressive and well-designed.",5 months ago,2025-01-24 14:16:47.158336,4.0,SAMIHOUSSEMEDDINE BABOUCHE,115,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112039458906226173652/reviews?hl=en-GB
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiN3N5c0ZREAE,"Best zoo we‚Äôve ever been. Maybe it was in August and all the Parisians are out for holidays. The zoo was very quiet to visit on a Sunday. Out little one really enjoyed the flat and easy walk in the park. The animals were glassed for better observation for the little ones. Appreciate the design. The feeding sessions of the sea lion was interactive as well. Overall, we had great time! If you have young child, I would suggest you bring them in a sling rather than push a pram.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtd29hMnNBRRAB,"I had the pleasure of visiting the Paris Zoo during a week long stay here in the city.  I visit a local zoo back home weekly, so I was eager to check this place out.  I must say, I was overall impressed. What I loved about the enclosures was how full of grass and plant life there was. Much more natural settings, as opposed to concrete.  What a variety of species too. I really loved the puma, baboons, and the wolves. While I wish some of the enclosures were bigger for the animal's sake, maybe down the road that can be done.  Another reviewer posted about how angry they were that some of the animals didn't come out during their visit. Newsflash...They don't have to! They have that right. Just be grateful there's a place like the Paris Zoo where they can live peacefully and be taken care of.
