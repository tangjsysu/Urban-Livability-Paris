ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMOXNTTzFRRRAB,"Pretty tree-lined square with a beautiful fountain ‚õ≤Ô∏è and children's play areas. In the 17th century, two adjoining private mansions stood on this site, one of which belonged to Fran√ßois Michel Le Tellier, Marquis of Louvois. In 1793, a theater, directed by Mademoiselle Montansier, replaced them. It was bought by the State in 1795 and became the first theater to have seats for spectators! In 1820, the assassination of the Duke of Berry, in front of the theater, led to its closure, then its destruction. In 1836, a first square was created, but it was Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand who gave it its current appearance. The fountain, by Louis Visconti, was erected in 1844. It is decorated with sculptures symbolizing the Seine, the Loire, the Sa√¥ne and the Garonne, works by Jean-Baptiste-jules Klagmann (1810-1867).",6 months ago,2024-12-28 16:36:10.514333,4.0,Laurent Padou,850,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102878442016850755868/reviews?hl=en
