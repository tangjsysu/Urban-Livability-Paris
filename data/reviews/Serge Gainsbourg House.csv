ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzOFp2MnpBRRAB,"This is now one of the must visit sites in Paris.  An audio guide given by Charlotte Gainsbourg will bring tears to your eyes of sadness, joy, wonder.  It's so deeply personal.  And being in the rooms she is describing is like a journey through the wardrobe into Narnia.  It's into the heart and mind of a creative genius. A truly rich and life enhancing experience.  Also the museum offers great additional insight and history into the man through films and artefacts.  The museum's cafe/bar is just beautiful and a great way to begin or end your visit.

The price for the entry IS publicly available on the website (visiter/informations pratiques) and IS NOT 40‚Ç¨, it's 25‚Ç¨ for both the house and the museum - with concessions available and a lower price (12‚Ç¨) if you only want to visit the museum. Definitely not what I would call a prohibitive price by Parisian standards.  The website IS available in French as well as in English.  The ticket office (billetterie) clearly differentiates between tickets for the museum only (billet mus√©e seul) and tickets for the museum and the house (billet maison et mus√©e).
