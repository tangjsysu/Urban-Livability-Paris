ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvcnRTc0dnEAE,"The tiny Square du Vert-Galant is located at the western tip of Ile de la Cite, just below the Equestrian statue of King Henri. This small park was bought by the city of Paris and converted in public space in 1884.  While being a very small area, Square du Vert-Galant is quite atmospheric and makes a great little spot to grab a park bench and rest your feet. It is a particularly nice place to visit after spending a few hours in nearby Notre Dame Cathedral and Saint Chapelle, also found at Ile de la Cite.  In addition to the nice green space, there is a bit of interesting history to this square as well. This is the supposed spot where two Order of the Temple dignitaries, Jacques de Molay and Geoffroy de Charnay were executed in March 1314. You can read about this on a plague, found on the middle pillar that forms part of Pont Neuf bridge, just below the King Henri statue.
