ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiMHU2ajR3RRAB,"I dined at La Fontaine Gaillon in Paris and was fortunate enough to enjoy the terrace, which truly sets this restaurant apart. It‚Äôs a timeless experience at the crossroads of a Parisian alley. The press has discussed about La Fontaine Gaillon, and its chef extensively. The cuisine is meticulous and creative, respecting the classics. The only issue is that it‚Äôs far too expensive for what you get on the plate in term of quantity, which is a pity.",5 months ago,2025-01-24 13:06:49.590000,4.0,Mr Z,278,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104314501790913028987/reviews?hl=en-GB

My gf and I stumbled across it- and it‚Äôs only been open 2 months- and can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not already packed of people (it‚Äôs only a matter of time). We had a classic French meal of escargot, steak au poive and green salad. And incredible cocktails. The service was above and beyond. And the decor is stunning.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYcnRqcWNREAE,"The service was great and the waitstaff were knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive.  The food was not bad .. it was not great. It was .. Ok. The food here is on par with what you might get at your local corner cafe -- except at multiples of the price.  The restaurant is located in a wonderful part of Paris, but for some reason, the curtains were drawn so you felt like you could be anywhere.  This restaurant is fine, but you can find much better in the area.  Another thing: when I went to pay the bill, the card machine presented me with choices to add a 10%, 15%, or 20% gratuity. That was especially disappointing given that unbeknown to most foreign visitors, a 18% minimum gratuity is already included in all restaurant bills. I saw that as a deceptive way to squeeze out more gratuity from unsuspecting tourists. It just left me with a feeling that this is a low-class place.",2 months ago,2025-01-24 13:06:49.592003,3.0,C S,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106871535888497510802/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQZ1lMcEV3EAE,"Dining Experience at La Fontaine Gaillon  La Fontaine Gaillon in Paris offers an exceptional dining experience that stands out in the city's vibrant culinary scene. The atmosphere is elegant and inviting, perfect for a memorable evening out.  One of the standout dishes of the evening, the terrine de foie gras with quince chutney and toasted bread is simply unparalleled. The texture is silky smooth, and the rich, buttery flavor of the foie gras is perfectly complemented by the sweet and tangy quince chutney, making it one of the best we've had the pleasure of tasting. It‚Äôs a must-try for any foie gras enthusiast.  The scallop carpaccio with citrus and passion fruit at La Fontaine Gaillon is an absolute delight, deserving to be savored with your eyes closed. The preparation highlights the natural sweetness of the scallops, paired expertly with the refreshing zest of citrus and the exotic hint of passion fruit, elevating the dish to a new level of culinary excellence.  The saffron mussel soup with leeks and fennel is a true culinary masterpiece. The rich, aromatic broth is infused with the delicate flavor of saffron, perfectly complementing the tender mussels. The addition of leeks and fennel adds layers of texture and subtle sweetness, making this dish a comforting and flavorful starter.  The sweetbread with morels and potato pur√©e is an exemplary dish that showcases the chef's skill in blending rich flavors and textures. The tender sweetbreads are perfectly cooked, and the earthy morels add a luxurious touch. The creamy potato pur√©e provides a comforting balance, making this dish a must-try for any diner seeking a gourmet experience.  The service was impeccable, with attentive staff ensuring a seamless dining experience from start to finish. The wine list is thoughtfully curated, offering a variety of options that pair beautifully with the exquisite menu. We opted for Les Champs Des Billons white wine. This choice beautifully complemented the rich and varied flavors of our meal, adding an extra layer of depth and enjoyment to the dining experience.  We finished our experience with the Red Fruit Pavlova, a delightful dessert that was both visually stunning and delicious. The meringue was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, filled with a generous assortment of fresh red fruits. It was a light and refreshing way to conclude a wonderful meal.  Overall, La Fontaine Gaillon provides a dining experience that is not only delightful to the palate but also an indulgence in elegance and sophistication. Highly recommended for those looking to enjoy the finest of Parisian cuisine.",a month ago,2025-01-24 13:06:49.594000,5.0,Nadim Akhmadeyev,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115496574457604276009/reviews?hl=en-GB
