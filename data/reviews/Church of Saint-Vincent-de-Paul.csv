ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNTNExmYV9RRRAB,"Superb church has Superb ‚Äúhuman-sized‚Äù church decorated with a magnificent organ. Very well maintained. Friendly, smiling parish team. Talented choir. Met the priest BINOT by chance in the building, warm contact. Several pretty statues (Our Lady, Jesus Christ, Saint Th√©r√®se, Virgin of Lourdes - sad face, too bad - with their particular altars, large selection of candles and night lights, many very interesting booklets on various subjects. In November, objects of worship (rosaries , statuettes, small books, crucifixes) offered to the faithful, delicate idea for personalized ceremonies for the deceased (not forgotten father Alain, coming from BURKINA FASO, August 16, 2016, funeral blessing dear mother full of emotion) then, after the death of my old dad, at the beginning of 2018, the two very kind ladies who also created a vibrant tribute to his memory). In this difficult time, we really need the comfort and serenity present in Saint Vincent! Catherine GOAPPER  Easter Sunday 2021. Mass at 10:30 a.m. Thank you to the entire parish team for this beautiful moment of sharing in fervor and fraternity. Congratulations to the talented cantor and organist, congratulations to the person who decorated the place so beautifully, Mr. the priest always smiling, the very serious altar boys (my grandfather was one before the war of 1914/1918 in his Tarn et Garonne natal), welcome to the newly baptized who have found the path to light!  Perfect organization, respect for distancing + ""barrier gestures"" did not in any way hinder the ceremony, ""usters"" helping the believers to find a place efficiently/rapidly.
