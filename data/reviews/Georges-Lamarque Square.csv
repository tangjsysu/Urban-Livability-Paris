ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjNzZMOXZ3RRAB,"This park area is for playing in. There are seats on one end for chatting. In the middle, there is a table tennis table but it looks like you need to supply your own ball and paddles. The other other end there is a children's playground. The place is quite large so there is enough space for a few children to run and chase after balls or each other. There is a fence around the whole park and another around the playground. There is a small path around the playground circumference where you can keep watch of children without getting run over by them. Quite a nice place for those with children.",4 years ago,2024-12-27 19:34:27.579369,4.0,Benedict Uy,"3,512",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117720045831313801659/reviews?hl=en-GB
