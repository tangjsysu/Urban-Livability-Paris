ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2dWRUUzJBRRAB,"One of my favorite museums here in Paris. It's a bit off the beaten path, and it can take a while to get there, but it's worth it, especially if you have an interest in this era.  They really have a very nice collection. The furniture and decor is mostly a miss, but the paintings and sculptures are excellent.  Very interesting special exhibits, too.  The place was almost empty when I went (free first Sunday of the month), so I had plenty of room to admire the art.  Oh and the staff are super friendly.",3 years ago,2025-03-15 21:53:48.510997,5.0,Fabian Joya,9,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105257119979473880281/reviews?hl=en-US

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxNHZQNmFnEAE,It is very rare that I find so much pleasure in discovering a museum. This was the case here. My friend had discovered this wonder and suggested we go there.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxZ3RuS0xnEAE,"My friend and I have just discovered this very beautiful museum located in the Boulogne media library very close to the town hall.  This museum clearly deserves to be better known. I'm sure there would be more visitors if it was right in the center of Paris. However, you can get there easily by car or even by taking metro line 1. We were delighted by our recent visit even if we were surprised to be the only ones wandering around the museum. We were dazzled by the collections spread over 3 floors: the very beautiful paintings, the sculptures, the reconstructions of apartment interiors and the furniture. The part that fascinated us the most was the one devoted to orientalism and artists from the colonial era. Too bad the museum is overheated.
