ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuaklXN0NREAE,"The greatest French chanson singer of the 20th century.  Edith Piaf died of liver cancer in October 1963. He was only 47 years old. Upon hearing of her death, Jean Cocteau was so shocked that he died four hours later. The French people were shocked and mourned the death of their national singer. As a Catholic, she hoped that her funeral would be held in a Catholic manner, but the conservative French Catholic Church at the time refused to hold a mass, saying that her life was not that of a Catholic. Instead, her funeral was held amidst tens of thousands of French people mourning Edith Piaf. Chanson, France's national music, originally has a long history, but the history of modern chanson began in the 20th century. Among them, Edith Piaf not only made a name for herself as the most representative singer of modern chanson through numerous performances and recordings, but also played a major role in promoting chanson to the world. It wasn't a very rosy life, and it wasn't so smooth that she could melt into a hymn of love, but at the end of her life, she would never have regretted anything about her life.",2 months ago,2024-12-27 19:49:55.809936,5.0,Roy L.,891,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115998753503066926030/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYcThETjJBRRAB,"As I stand in front of Édith Piaf's grave in the Père Lachaise cemetery, I am struck by a deep sense of awe. The simple gravestone made of black marble appears reserved, almost modest, which contrasts with her great legacy as one of the most important chanson singers in France. Her name is engraved in gold letters: Édith Giovanna Gassion, dite Édith Piaf. Her daughter and her last husband, Théo Sarapo, are also buried next to her, underlining the importance of family and love in her life.  Flowers and small souvenirs are placed on the gravestone, a silent reminder that she is not forgotten. Visitors come to express their appreciation and I feel like I am part of a silent ritual that lasts eternity. Many of the people who pass here have a Piaf song in their head – perhaps “La Vie en rose” or “Non, je ne regrette rien” – and I can almost feel their music permeating this place as if it were here still present.  It is a strange feeling to stand in front of the grave of such a famous woman who, despite her difficult childhood and personal tragedies, became a symbol of the soul of Paris. The quiet of the cemetery, the gentle rustling of the leaves and the simple gravesite invite you to pause and reflect on the life and legacy of a woman who touched millions of people with her unique voice.  As I leave the grave, I feel Édith Piaf's spirit still watching over the city, her voice echoing in the hearts of the people who loved her. It is a place of remembrance, but also of inspiration - a testament to the power of music and humanity.
