ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnc1B6ZzFBRRAB,We have done the military base 423. Even though advertised tgat an English version is available the guide wasn't really able to speak and the game had a few things which were not translated. Without my French friends I wouldn't have been able to solve the room. The room itself was alright. Definitely worth doing but not great.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQOWJxbzZ3RRAB,"Good morning,  We were at Escap Lab last night with a jungle theme. The atmosphere was nice, but the Jungle Escape Room was too dark in our opinion. We came as beginners, and I find it a bit complicated to solve so many puzzles in the dark. Furthermore, for 28 euros per person (there were 7 of us), I found the room a little disappointing in terms of realism and dynamism.  There was too much written content and not enough intuitive steps. Coming from abroad, I had the opportunity to test other Escape Rooms in France, and I must say that the value for money here was really disappointing. Furthermore, the room was not big enough for a group of 7 people. We expected better, despite our beginner level.
