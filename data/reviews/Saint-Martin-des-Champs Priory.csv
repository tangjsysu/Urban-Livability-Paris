ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhN3NHeG5RRRAB,"LIBERTY STATUE (interior) Liberty Enlightening the World, better known as the Statue of Liberty, is one of the most famous monuments in the United States. It was offered by France, as a sign of friendship between the two nations, to celebrate the centenary of the American Declaration of Independence. The statue was inaugurated on October 28, 1886, while in 1879, Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi called on the engineer Gustave Eiffel for the internal structure of the statue. The Museum of Arts and Crafts allows you to discover the history of this statue and the stages of its construction. Statue of Liberty: a plaster and a bronze at the Museum of Arts and Crafts: It is not in bronze but it weighs its weight. Made entirely of plaster, the construction model which rests in the Museum of Arts and Crafts weighs no less than 14 tonnes. It is this that Auguste Bartholdi will use to create, by enlargement, the New York Statue of Liberty. The museum also houses a reproduction, also in plaster, scale 1/16, from 1876.
