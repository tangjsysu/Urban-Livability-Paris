ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBdnFHcUJnEAE,"Giving two stars mainly for how the bassin is handled. We arrived last weekend a bit before 18 (it's open till 21). It was already full which is understandable with the nice weather. And I like they keep a maximum number of people to not get overcrowded or create unsafe situations. What I would have not expected, is that once it's full they close! They don't let people in, even when numerous families leaving. So at 19.30 it was basically empty, with another 90 minutes till ""offical"" closing time and they just keep it closed. I would love to understand the reasoning behind it because would that mean that if the Bassin is full at let's say, 10:30 - they would not open up for the entire day?!",6 years ago,2025-01-24 13:52:19.247510,2.0,Veronique Houtepen,4,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117849634123526843944/reviews?hl=en
