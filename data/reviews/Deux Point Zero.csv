ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNveHAycVVREAE,"The bar is located close to the subway and fast foods but is in a small street so it's nice, not too exposed. The concept of this bar is geek - video games, they have few game machines and they also have a room downstairs where they organise theme nights (Mario kart, etc.) and people car bring their own remote? to play with each other. Also they use nice Mario kart eco cups consign√© 2‚Ç¨ , it's cool but make sure to keep your cup around because some people will bring it back and get the 2‚Ç¨ for them. I'd say it's more a geeky bar than a bar where you can dance like crazy (the sound volume isn't crazy).",5 years ago,2025-01-24 13:20:52.808506,5.0,Clara Li,190,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109867291205390615211/reviews?hl=en-GB
