ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJaWNLaG1nRRAB,One of the interesting things to see at Place des Pyramides is the gilded Equestrian statue of Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc). This Historic Monuent is the works of French sculptor Emmanuel FrÃ©miet (1874).  Here you see a solid gold figure of Joan on horseback. She is dressed in a suit of armour and holds a flag up high with her right hand. It is an intriguing depiction of the national heroine that can be conveniently viewed when sightseeing near Musee du Louvre and Jardin des Tuileries.,6 years ago,2025-01-24 13:16:34.163988,4.0,Brad,"5,578",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews?hl=en
