ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkNU0tVnVRRRAB,"This dog park in Paris is simply to be avoided. As soon as you enter, you are struck by its tiny size which is not even suitable for a few dogs. The place is dark, gloomy and has a stifling atmosphere. The facilities are non-existent and the grass rarely seems to be maintained. It's sad to see our four-legged friends confined in such an unwelcoming space. I was really disappointed with this experience, and I would not recommend it to anyone. Dogs deserve better than this park, it's just horrible.",10 months ago,2024-12-28 16:57:04.376463,1.0,Romain Granger,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107657102184856196401/reviews?hl=en-GB

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodU9taWVREAE,"Damage ! Yet another creation of a space without consultation with users. Grilles on the ground (friendly for paws), no maintenance (becomes a mud pool in winter and an arid desert in summer), very little light at night, water point outside the park and half closed of the year. And we're not talking about the ridiculous size. But at least our animals have the right to walk on something other than concrete! Thank you the city of Paris for this great understanding of dogs üëè",a year ago,2024-12-28 16:57:04.376463,1.0,C B,17,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106077284865080857884/reviews?hl=en-GB
