The gift shop was not super big but not small either.  I'm taking off one star because I feel the museum is lacking in signage. When we entered, the security guards told us to check our bags but it wasn't obvious that the coatroom was on the floor below. Secondly, some of the elevators didn't go to all the floors.

On top of that, the MAD has an astounding jewelry collection (if you like jewelry, study jewelry, or like shiny things, a must!), fantastic collections of furniture and clothing through out the ages (my favorite was the Art Nouveau rooms and decor). Finally, we also saw the Fashion in Sports exhibit for the Paris Olympics which was amazing and educative (seeing what upper class citizens wore to play sports in 1800s, evolution of women‚Äôs rights and their ability to participate in sports, even a few pieces on an openly lesbian athlete in 1914, finally artistic fashion pieces for Olympics).
