ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN3aVpieHdRRRAB,"From the 3rd century thermal baths were built in Lut√©ce. The thermal baths of Cluny were undoubtedly built by the powerful corporation of Nautes Parisiens. In fact, the vault room has a structure in the shape of a ship and the decorations with fish motifs confirm this hypothesis. Gallo-Roman cohabitation was to allow members of the Brotherhood of Nautes free access to the thermal baths. All that remains is the coldest room of the thermal baths (the frigidarium) where you can notice the lines of red bricks which are a Roman architectural mark found throughout the Mediterranean basin. This structure, strong enough to have survived to this day, once supported a hanging garden with trees.
