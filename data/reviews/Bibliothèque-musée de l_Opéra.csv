The architecture and style will simply blow your mind, not to mention how immaculately preserved it is. The Opera house is still fully functional with shows almost everyday so maybe that helps in its upkeep and maintenance. The main staircase is a masterpiece itself.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNndGNPZEZnEAE,"Mass tourism is a curse for the museum (contrary to what the director of the Louvre declared in a Spanish newspaper in February 2025).  I am lucky enough to know the Op√©ra Garnier site well and to be familiar with different study departments at the BnF.  For several years, reception and visit conditions have been appalling. Although probably redesigned, the entrance through the Emperor's rotunda is chaotic. The organization of queues is a technique that is not mastered here. You will have to elbow your way through the crowds. But above all, remember to reserve your tickets well in advance because the places are very popular with groups.  I did not enjoy introducing our teenage godson to the Opera. Yes, it‚Äôs beautiful, it‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs a place of architecture, music and history. Nevertheless, in all this tohu-bohu it is difficult to enjoy it. The site will soon be closed for work for many years.  I imagine the heartbreak for the curators of the Performing Arts departments and the study library. And I am happy to know Garnier's first library, the circular library under the dome of the west rotunda",3 weeks ago,2025-03-15 22:03:30.961725,1.0,Th√©ophile M√©randier,172,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110140097668479374857/reviews?hl=en

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR3MHJLVnBnRRAB,"Installed in the Emperor's pavilion, to the west of the building, the Opera library-museum has nearly 600,000 documents (books, periodicals, scores, programs, prints, etc.) accumulated over the years , as well as some works of art and various objects (costumes, set models, paintings, stage jewelry, etc.).  Today attached to the music department of the National Library of France, this collection was officially created in 1866 under the initiative of the archivist Charles Nuittier, but it was not until 1881 that it was stored in its current structure and that a museum is attached to it.  The pavilion has retained its magnificent period decor and offers three spaces in its own right: the lounge which serves as a reading room, the old smoking room in which the permanent collections were installed, and finally the lower rotunda dedicated to temporary exhibitions. .  The museum part is accessible to all visitors to the Palais Garnier.
