ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3dzlhRzh3RRAB,"Jardin des Tuileries, often translated as Tuileries Garden, is a royal garden with a long history located in the center of Paris, France. Its history can be traced back to the end of the 16th century, when it was built as a private garden for the French royal family. Part of the banks of the Seine that was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1991. The gardens were designed by Catherine de Medici in 1564 as the gardens of her residence, the Palais des Tuileries. Originally created primarily to decorate the Tuileries Palace, the gardens were carefully designed as a private space for the royal family, with gorgeous landscaping and elegant arrangements. At the end of the 17th century, Louis XIV decided to open the garden to the public, becoming the first royal garden in France open to the public. This decision not only allowed the public to enjoy this exquisite green space, but also marked an important turning point in the history of France. During the Paris Commune in 1871, the Tuileries Palace was razed to the ground by revolutionaries. The Tuileries Palace, which was burned down during the French Revolution, was not demolished until 1883, and the original site of the palace became part of the Tuileries Garden. The Tuileries Garden is located on the left bank of the Seine, adjacent to the Musée du Louvre. The gardens cover approximately 25 hectares and feature an elegant layout and rich historical heritage. The garden is planted with a variety of trees, flowers and sculptures, as well as open lawns and tranquil fountains. It is not only a good place for Parisians to take a leisurely walk, but also an excellent place to appreciate the French gardening style.",4 months ago,2025-01-24 12:52:59.689505,5.0,Zijian Hua,419,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103103648745815029344/reviews?hl=en
