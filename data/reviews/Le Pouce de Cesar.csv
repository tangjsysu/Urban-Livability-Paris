ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzak1LczdBRRAB,"Le Pouce is a play by Caesar. It is one of the works of art preserved in La D√©fense, France, an example of the series of works of the same name. The work is located next to the CNIT. It represents the author's enlarged thumb (1.85 m tall). In this regard he invokes his ""narcissism"" and the convenience offered by the immediate availability of the model. In 1965, the Claude-Bernard gallery in Paris commissioned a work from C√©sar for the exhibition ‚ÄúRodin's hand to Picasso‚Äù. The sculptor, having discovered the principle of pantographic enlargement, made the impression of his thumb using a molding which he enlarged up to 40 cm, but having few means at his disposal at the time, it was made of translucent pink plastic. Faced with the success of the work with its evident phallic symbolism, he decided to duplicate it in different sizes and materials. La D√©fense ordered one from him in 1989. The Thumb was inaugurated on the square in front of la D√©fense in 1994.
