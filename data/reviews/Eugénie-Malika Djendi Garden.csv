ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuNHR6dy1nRRAB,"Amazing square garden, with trees and flowers. It includes a memorial to soldiers who died in external operations. The name of this garden pays homage to the S/LTN Eug√©nie Diendi (1923-1945), radio operator of the North African Women's Signal Corps, parachuted by the Special Services of Algiers into occupied France. Arrested and deported in early 1944, she was executed on January 18, 1945 in Ravensbr√ºck. Declared Dead for France.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTd2NfMmZBEAE,"What do we do ? We really like this garden despite its very concrete reorganization for the war memorial (which is still just as dangerous, fortunately my son had kept his helmet after putting the scooter down, otherwise we ended up in Necker! The guardrails are not compliant I I'm going to send another letter!) What do we do in the ""maze""? It is more and more complicated to walk there see photos. When will there be an intervention? It becomes very dangerous for children and the elderly, for everyone if we don't constantly watch where we're stepping. Close this space for security reasons or intervene but this is no longer possible!  My review from December 2020: Mixed review./ 3 stars At the same time a beautiful monument, which pays tribute, although cold and concreted. But at the same time, the massacre of the trees that had been there for a long time, one of them was majestic. And we really liked this little corner for snacks with our grown-up. And hello the danger with the handrails which have been added and are not compliant!!!! There have been accidents! Despite my message to the town hall and having warned parents, some children ended up in hospital after taking the bars head-on. I hope that the town hall will react rather than saying that everything is in compliance",2 years ago,2025-01-24 12:35:13.306033,2.0,Aurore Ba&Be,41,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103551549352818982372/reviews?hl=en
